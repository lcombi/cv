  abstract = {The detection of a binary neutron star merger in 2017 through both gravitational waves and electromagnetic emission opened a new era of multimessenger astronomy. The understanding of the magnetic field amplification triggered by the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability during the merger is still a numerically unresolved problem because of the relevant small scales involved. One of the uncertainties comes from the simplifications usually assumed in the initial magnetic topology of merging neutron stars. We perform high-resolution, convergent large-eddy simulations of binary neutron star mergers, following the newly formed remnant for up to \$30\$ milliseconds. Here we specifically focus on the comparison between simulations with different initial magnetic configurations, going beyond the widespread-used aligned dipole confined within each star. The results obtained show that the initial topology is quickly forgotten, in a timescale of few miliseconds after the merger. Moreover, at the end of the simulations, the average intensity (\$B\textbackslash sim 10\^\{16\}\$ G) and the spectral distribution of magnetic energy over spatial scales barely depend on the initial configuration. This is expected due to the small-scale efficient dynamo involved, and thus it holds as long as: (i) the initial large-scale magnetic field is not unrealistically high (as often imposed in mergers studies); (ii) the turbulent instability is numerically (at least partially) resolved, so that the amplified magnetic energy is distributed across a wide range of scales and becomes orders-of-magnitude larger than the initial one.},

  abstract = {The Numerical INJection Analysis (NINJA) project is a collaborative effort between members of the numerical relativity and gravitational wave data analysis communities. The purpose of NINJA is to study the sensitivity of existing gravitational-wave search and parameter-estimation algorithms using numerically generated waveforms, and to foster closer collaboration between the numerical relativity and data analysis communities. The first NINJA project used only a small number of injections of short numerical-relativity waveforms, which limited its ability to draw quantitative conclusions. The goal of the NINJA-2 project is to overcome these limitations with long post-Newtonian - numerical relativity hybrid waveforms, large numbers of injections, and the use of real detector data. We report on the submission requirements for the NINJA-2 project and the construction of the waveform catalog. Eight numerical relativity groups have contributed 63 hybrid waveforms consisting of a numerical portion modelling the late inspiral, merger, and ringdown stitched to a post-Newtonian portion modelling the early inspiral. We summarize the techniques used by each group in constructing their submissions. We also report on the procedures used to validate these submissions, including examination in the time and frequency domains and comparisons of waveforms from different groups against each other. These procedures have so far considered only the \$(\textbackslash ell,m)=(2,2)\$ mode. Based on these studies we judge that the hybrid waveforms are suitable for NINJA-2 studies. We note some of the plans for these investigations.},

  abstract = {Context: High-mass microquasars are binary systems consisting of a massive star and an accreting compact object from which relativistic jets are launched. There is considerable observational evidence that winds of massive stars are clumpy. Individual clumps may interact with the jets in high-mass microquasars to produce outbursts of high-energy emission. Gamma-ray flares have been detected in some high-mass X-ray binaries, such as Cygnus X-1, and probably in LS 5039 and LS I+61 303. Aims: We predict the high-energy emission produced by the interaction between a jet and a clump of the stellar wind in a high-mass microquasar. Methods: Assuming a hydrodynamic scenario for the jet-clump interaction, we calculate the spectral energy distributions produced by the dominant non-thermal processes: relativistic bremsstrahlung, synchrotron and inverse Compton radiation, for leptons, and for hadrons, proton-proton collisions. Results: Significant levels of emission in X-rays (synchrotron), high-energy gamma rays (inverse Compton), and very high-energy gamma rays (from the decay of neutral pions) are predicted, with luminosities in the different domains in the range \textasciitilde 1032-1035 erg s-1. The spectral energy distributions vary strongly depending on the specific conditions. Conclusions: Jet-clump interactions may be detectable at high and very high energies, and provide an explanation for the fast TeV variability found in some high-mass X-ray binary systems. Our model can help to infer information about the properties of jets and clumpy winds by means of high-sensitivity gamma-ray astronomy.},

  abstract = {Context. Dense and cold clouds seem to populate the broad line region surrounding the central black hole in AGNs. These clouds may interact with the AGN jet base which could have observational consequences. Aims: We study the gamma-ray emission produced by these jet-cloud interactions, and explore the conditions under which this radiation would be detectable. Methods: We investigate the hydrodynamical properties of jet-cloud interactions and the resulting shocks, and develop a model to compute the spectral energy distribution of the emission generated by the particles accelerated in these shocks. We discuss our model in the context of radio-loud AGNs, with applications to two representative cases, the low-luminous Centaurus A and the powerful 3C 273. Results: Some fraction of the jet power may be channelled into gamma-ray energy, which is likely to be dominated by synchrotron self-Compton radiation, and have typical variability timescales similar to the cloud lifetime within the jet, which is longer than several hours. Many clouds can interact with the jet simultaneously leading to fluxes significantly higher than in one interaction, but then variability will be smoothed out. Conclusions: Jet-cloud interactions may produce detectable gamma-rays in non-blazar AGNs that are transient in nearby low-luminous sources such as Cen A, and steady in the case of powerful objects of FR II type.},

  abstract = {Because the magnetorotational instability is capable of exponentially amplifying weak pre-existing magnetic fields, it might be hoped that the character of the magnetic field in accretion disks would be independent of the nature of the seed field. However, the divergence-free nature of magnetic fields in highly conducting fluids ensures that their largescale topology is preserved, no matter how greatly the field intensity is changed. By performing global two- and threedimensional general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic disk simulations with several different topologies for the initial magnetic field, we explore the degree to which the character of the flows around black holes depends on the initial topology. We find that while the qualitative properties of the accretion flow are nearly independent of field topology, jet launching is very sensitive to it; a sense of vertical field consistent for at least an inner disk inflow time is essential to the support of strong jets.},

  abstract = {I will discuss several issues related to the acceleration, collimation, and propagation of jets from active galactic nuclei. Hydromagnetic stresses provide the best bet for both accelerating relativistic flows and providing a certain amount of initial collimation. However, there are limits to how much "self-collimation" can be achieved without the help of an external pressurized medium. Moreover, existing models, which postulate highly organized poloidal flux near the base of the flow, are probably unrealistic. Instead, a large fraction of the magnetic energy may reside in highly disorganized "chaotic" fields. Such a field can also accelerate the flow to relativistic speeds, in some cases with greater efficiency than highly organized fields, but at the expense of self-collimation. The observational interpretation of jet physics is still hampered by a dearth of unambiguous diagnostics. Propagating disturbances in flows, such as the oblique shocks that may constitute the kiloparsec-scale "knots" in the M87 jet, may provide a wide range of untapped diagnostics for jet properties.},

The basic assumption which led to Kerr solution was that \$\textbackslash boldsymbol\{k\}\$ be both geodesic and shearfree. This condition is relaxed here and Kerr-Schild ansatz is revised by treating Kerr-Schild metrics as \{\textbackslash it exact linear perturbations\} of Minkowski spacetime. The scalar function \$H\$ is taken as the perturbing function, so that Einstein's field equations are solved order by order in powers of \$H\$. It turns out that the congruence must be geodesic and shearfree as a consequence of third and second order equations, leading to an alternative derivation of Kerr solution.},

  abstract = {To be observed and analyzed by the network of gravitational wave detectors on ground (LIGO, VIRGO, etc.) and by the future detectors in space (LISA, etc.), inspiralling compact binaries --- binary star systems composed of neutron stars and/or black holes in their late stage of evolution --- require high-accuracy templates predicted by general relativity theory. The gravitational waves emitted by these very relativistic systems can be accurately modelled using a high-order post-Newtonian gravitational wave generation formalism. In this article, we present the current state of the art on post-Newtonian methods as applied to the dynamics and gravitational radiation of general matter sources (including the radiation reaction back onto the source) and inspiralling compact binaries. We describe the post-Newtonian equations of motion, in Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formalisms, pay attention to the self-field regularizations at work, discuss several notions of innermost circular orbits and make comparisons with numerical gravitational self-force computations. The gravitational waveform and energy flux are obtained with high post-Newtonian precision. Some landmark results are discussed in the case of eccentric compact binaries moving on quasi-elliptical orbits, and on spin-orbit coupling effects in black hole binaries.},

These active galactic nuclei (AGNs) can form jets that are observed on scales from astronomical units to megaparsecs and from meter wavelengths to TeV energies. High-resolution radio imaging and multiwavelength/messenger campaigns are elucidating the conditions under which this happens. Evidence is presented that: {$\blacksquare$} Relativistic AGN jets are formed when the black hole spins and the the accretion disk is strongly magnetized, perhaps on account of gas accreting at high latitude beyond the black hole sphere of influence. {$\blacksquare$} AGN jets are collimated close to the black hole by magnetic stress associated with a disk wind. {$\blacksquare$} Higher-power jets can emerge from their galactic nuclei in a relativistic, supersonic, and proton-dominated state, and they terminate in strong, hot spot shocks; lower-power jets are degraded to buoyant plumes and bubbles. {$\blacksquare$} Jets may accelerate protons to EeV energies, which contribute to the cosmic ray spectrum and may initiate pair cascades that can efficiently radiate synchrotron {$\gamma$}-rays. {$\blacksquare$} Jets were far more common when the Universe was a few billion years old and black holes and massive galaxies were growing rapidly. {$\blacksquare$} Jets can have a major influence on their environments, stimulating and limiting the growth of galaxies.The observational prospects for securing our understanding of AGN jets are bright.},

  abstract = {Context. Several gamma-ray binaries show extended X-ray emission that may be associated to interactions of an outflow with the medium. Some of these systems are, or may be, high-mass binaries harboring young nonaccreting pulsars, in which the stellar and the pulsar winds collide, generating a powerful outflow that should terminate at some point in the ambient medium. Aims: This work studies the evolution and termination, as well as the related radiation, of the shocked-wind flow generated in high-mass binaries hosting powerful pulsars. Methods: A characterization, based on previous numerical work, is given for the stellar/pulsar wind interaction. Then, an analytical study of the further evolution of the shocked flow and its dynamical impact on the surrounding medium is carried out. Finally, the expected nonthermal emission from the flow termination shock, likely the dominant emitting region, is calculated. Results: The shocked wind structure, initially strongly asymmetric, becomes a quasi-spherical, supersonically expanding bubble, with its energy coming from the pulsar and mass from the stellar wind. This bubble eventually interacts with the environment on \textasciitilde pc scales, producing a reverse and, sometimes, a forward shock. Nonthermal leptonic radiation can be efficient in the reverse shock. Radio emission is expected to be faint, whereas X-rays can easily reach detectable fluxes. Under very low magnetic fields and large nonthermal luminosities, gamma rays may also be significant. Conclusions: The complexity of the stellar/pulsar wind interaction is likely to be smoothed out outside the binary system, where the wind-mixed flow accelerates and eventually terminates in a strong reverse shock. This shock may be behind the extended X-rays observed in some binary systems. For very powerful pulsars, part of the unshocked pulsar wind may directly interact with the large-scale environment.},

  abstract = {Context. Converging flows with strong magnetic fields of different  polarity can accelerate particles through magnetic reconnection. If the particle mean free path is longer than the reconnection layer is thick, but much shorter than the entire reconnection structure, the particle will mostly interact with the incoming flows potentially with a very low escape probability. Aims: We explore, in general and also in some specific scenarios, the possibility of particles to be accelerated in a magnetic reconnection layer by interacting only with the incoming flows.  Methods: We characterize converging flows that undergo magnetic reconnection, and derive analytical estimates for the particle energy distribution, acceleration rate, and maximum energies achievable in these flows. We also discuss a scenario, based on jets dominated by magnetic fields of changing polarity, in which this mechanism may operate. Results: The proposed acceleration mechanism operates if the reconnection layer is much thinner than its transversal characteristic size, and the magnetic field has a disordered component. Synchrotron losses may prevent electrons from entering in this acceleration regime. The acceleration rate should be faster, and the energy distribution of particles harder than in standard diffusive shock acceleration. The interaction of obstacles with the innermost region of jets in active galactic nuclei and microquasars may be suitable sites for particle acceleration in converging flows.},

  abstract = {Context. Galactic and extragalactic relativistic jets are surrounded by  rich environments that are full of moving objects, such as stars and dense medium inhomogeneities. These objects can enter into the jets and generate shocks and non-thermal emission. Aims: We characterize the emitting properties of the downstream region of a standing shock formed due to the interaction of a relativistic jet with an obstacle. We focus on the case of red giants interacting with an extragalactic jet.  Methods: We perform relativistic axisymmetric hydrodynamical simulations of a relativistic jet meeting an obstacle of very large inertia. The results are interpreted in the framework of a red giant whose dense and slow wind interacts with the jet of an active galactic nucleus. Assuming that particles are accelerated in the standing shock generated in the jet as it impacts the red giant wind, we compute the non-thermal particle distribution, the Doppler boosting enhancement, and the non-thermal luminosity in gamma rays. Results: The available non-thermal energy from jet-obstacle interactions is potentially enhanced by a factor of \textasciitilde 100 when accounting for the whole surface of the shock induced by the obstacle, instead of just the obstacle section. The observer gamma-ray luminosity, including the effective obstacle size, the flow velocity and Doppler boosting effects, can be \textasciitilde 300 ({$\gamma$}j/10)2 times higher than when the emitting flow is assumed at rest and only the obstacle section is considered, where {$\gamma$}j is the jet Lorentz factor. For a whole population of red giants inside the jet of an active galactic nucleus, the predicted persistent gamma-ray luminosities may be potentially detectable for a jet pointing approximately to the observer.  Conclusions: Obstacles interacting with relativistic outflows, for instance clouds and populations of stars for extragalactic jets, or stellar wind inhomogeneities in microquasar jets and in winds of pulsars in binaries, should be taken into account when investigating the origin of the non-thermal emission from these sources.},

  abstract = {Context. High-mass microquasar jets propagate under the effect of the  wind from the companion star, and the orbital motion of the binary system. The stellar wind and the orbit may be dominant factors determining the jet properties beyond the binary scales. Aims: This is an analytical study, performed to characterise the effects of the stellar wind and the orbital motion on the jet properties.  Methods: Accounting for the wind thrust transferred to the jet, we derive analytical estimates to characterise the jet evolution under the impact of the stellar wind. We include the Coriolis force effect, induced by orbital motion and enhanced by the wind's presence. Large-scale evolution of the jet is sketched, accounting for wind-to-jet thrust transfer, total energy conservation, and wind-jet flow mixing.  Results: If the angle of the wind-induced jet bending is larger than its half-opening angle, the following is expected: (I) a strong recollimation shock; (II) bending against orbital motion, caused by Coriolis forces and enhanced by the wind presence; and (III) non-ballistic helical propagation further away. Even if disrupted, the jet can re-accelerate due to ambient pressure gradients, but wind entrainment can weaken this acceleration. On large scales, the opening angle of the helical structure is determined by the wind-jet thrust relation, and the wind-loaded jet flow can be rather slow.  Conclusions: The impact of stellar winds on high-mass microquasar jets can yield non-ballistic helical jet trajectories, jet partial disruption and wind mixing, shocks, and possibly non-thermal emission. Among other observational diagnostics, such as radiation variability at any band, the radio morphology on milliarcsecond scales can be informative on the wind-jet interaction.},

We focus on 2D hydrodynamical studies of comparable-mass, non-spinning systems. Relativistic effects alter the dynamics of gas in this environment in several ways. Because the gravitational potential between the two BHs becomes shallower than in the Newtonian regime, the mini-disks stretch toward the L1 point and the amount of gas passing back and forth between the mini disks increases sharply with decreasing binary separation. This ``sloshing'' is quasi-periodically modulated at 2 and 2.75 times the binary orbital frequency, corresponding to timescales of hours to days for supermassive binary black holes (SMBBHs). In addition, relativistic effects add an m = 1 component to the tidally driven spiral waves in the disks that are purely m = 2 in Newtonian gravity; this component becomes dominant when the separation is {$\lessequivlnt$}100 gravitational radii. Both the sloshing and the spiral waves have the potential to create distinctive radiation features that may uniquely mark SMBBHs in the relativistic regime.},

Mass flow through the accretion streams linking the circumbinary disk to the mini-disks is modulated quasi-periodically by the streams' interaction with a nonlinear m=1 density feature, or ``lump,'' at the inner edge of the circumbinary disk: the stream supplying each mini-disk comes into phase with the lump at a frequency 0.74 times the binary orbital frequency. Because the binary is relativistic, the tidal truncation radii of the mini-disks are not much larger than their innermost stable circular orbits; consequently, the mini-disks' inflow times are shorter than the conventional estimate and are comparable to the stream modulation period. As a result, the mini-disks are always in inflow disequilibrium, with their masses and spiral density wave structures responding to the stream's quasi-periodic modulation. The fluctuations in each mini-disk's mass are so large that as much as 75\% of the total mini-disk mass can be contained within a single mini-disk. Such quasi-periodic modulation of the mini-disk structure may introduce distinctive time-dependent features in the binary's electromagnetic emission.},

We extend this simulation from 3 to 12 binary orbital periods. We find that relativistic SMBBH accretion acts as a resonant cavity, where quasi-periodic oscillations tied to the frequency at which the black hole's (BH's) orbital phase matches a nonlinear m = 1 density feature, or ``lump,'' in the circumbinary accretion disk permeate the system. The rate of mass accretion onto each of the mini-disks around the BHs is modulated at the beat frequency between the binary frequency and the lump's mean orbital frequency, i.e., , while the total mass accretion rate of this equal-mass binary is modulated at two different frequencies, and . The instantaneous rotation rate of the lump itself is also modulated at two frequencies close to the modulation frequencies of the total accretion rate, and . Because of the compact nature of the mini-disks in SMBBHs approaching merger, the inflow times within the mini-disks are comparable to the period on which their mass supply varies, so that their masses\textemdash and the accretion rates they supply to their BHs\textemdash are strongly modulated at the same frequency. In essence, the azimuthal symmetry of the circumbinary disk is broken by the dynamics of orbits near a binary, and this m = 1 asymmetry then drives quasi-periodic variation throughout the system, including both accretion and disk-feeding. In SMBBHs approaching merger, such time variability could introduce distinctive, increasingly rapid, fluctuations in their electromagnetic emission.},

  abstract = {Context. The neutrino event IceCube-170922A appears to originate from  the BL Lac object TXS 0506+056. To understand the neutrino creation process and to localize the emission site, we studied the radio images of the jet at 15 GHz. Aims: Other BL Lac objects show properties similar to those of TXS 0506+056, such as multiwavelength variability or a curved jet. However, to date only TXS 0506+056 has been identified as neutrino emitter. The aim of this paper is to determine what makes the parsec-scale jet of TXS 0506+056 specific in this respect.  Methods: We reanalyzed and remodeled 16 VLBA 15 GHz observations between 2009 and 2018. We thoroughly examined the jet kinematics and flux-density evolution of individual jet components during the time of enhanced neutrino activity between September 2014 and March 2015, and in particular before and after the neutrino event. Results: Our results suggest that the jet is very strongly curved and most likely observable under a special viewing angle of close to zero. We may observe the interaction between jet features that cross each other's paths. We find subsequent flux-density flaring of six components passing the likely collision site. In addition, we find a strong indication for precession of the inner jet, and model a precession period of about 10 yr via the Lense-Thirring effect. We discuss an alternative scenario, which is the interpretation of observing the signature of two jets within TXS 0506+056, again hinting toward a collision of jetted material. We essentially suggest that the neutrino emission may result from the interaction of jetted material in combination with a special viewing angle and jet precession. Conclusions: We propose that the enhanced neutrino activity during the neutrino flare in 2014-2015 and the single EHE neutrino IceCube-170922A could have been generated by a cosmic collision within TXS 0506+056. Our findings seem capable of explaining the neutrino generation at the time of a low gamma-ray flux and also indicate that TXS 0506+056 might be an atypical blazar. It seems to be the first time that a potential collision of two jets on parsec scales has been reported and that the detection of a cosmic neutrino might be traced back to a cosmic jet-collision.},

All eleven papers constituting this volume were written for it. The problems tackled in this book concern certain basic concepts, hypotheses, theories, and research programmes in physical science. Some of these problems are topical, others new, but they are all fundamental and the subject of research and controversy. Consequently this volume is expected to serve those students, teachers and researchers who enjoy learning, teaching, discussing or doing theoretical physics. It is addressed to the nine to niners rather than to the nine to fivers. It is expected to attract the theoretician in search for new basic ideas, the teacher eager to perfect his understanding of physical theory and transmit his own zeal and his own doubts, as well as the student anxious to get down to essentials. This book may also interest the mathematician for whom physics offers a challenge (or a good pretext). Finally, it should get the attention of the philosopher of science aware of the advantages of philosophizing on foundations research problems rather than on the popularization of some results of research. There are at least two reasons for valuing foundations research.},

  abstract = {Pulsar timing array (PTA) collaborations in North America, Australia, and Europe, have been exploiting the exquisite timing precision of millisecond pulsars over decades of observations to search for correlated timing deviations induced by gravitational waves (GWs). PTAs are sensitive to the frequency band ranging just below 1~nanohertz to a few tens of microhertz. The discovery space of this band is potentially rich with populations of inspiraling supermassive black hole binaries, decaying cosmic string networks, relic post-inflation GWs, and even non-GW imprints of axionic dark matter. This article aims to provide an understanding of the exciting open science questions in cosmology, galaxy evolution, and fundamental physics that will be addressed by the detection and study of GWs through PTAs. The focus of the article is on providing an understanding of the mechanisms by which PTAs can address specific questions in these fields, and to outline some of the subtleties and difficulties in each case. The material included is weighted most heavily toward the questions which we expect will be answered in the near-term with PTAs; however, we have made efforts to include most currently anticipated applications of nanohertz GWs.},

  abstract = {Recent advances in general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations have expanded and improved our understanding of the dynamics of black-hole accretion disks. However, current simulations do not capture the thermodynamics of electrons in the low density accreting plasma. This poses a significant challenge in predicting accretion flow images and spectra from first principles. Because of this, simplified emission models have often been used, with widely different configurations (e.g., disk- versus jet-dominated emission), and were able to account for the observed spectral properties of accreting black holes. Exploring the large parameter space introduced by such models, however, requires significant computational power that exceeds conventional computational facilities. In this paper, we use GRay, a fast graphics processing unit (GPU) based ray-tracing algorithm, on the GPU cluster El Gato, to compute images and spectra for a set of six general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations with different magnetic field configurations and black-hole spins. We also employ two different parametric models for the plasma thermodynamics in each of the simulations. We show that, if only the spectral properties of Sgr A{${_\ast}$} are used, all 12 models tested here can fit the spectra equally well. However, when combined with the measurement of the image size of the emission using the Event Horizon Telescope, current observations rule out all models with strong funnel emission, because the funnels are typically very extended. Our study shows that images of accretion flows with horizon-scale resolution offer a powerful tool in understanding accretion flows around black holes and their thermodynamic properties.},

  abstract = {Merging binary neutron stars (BNSs) represent the ultimate targets for multimessenger astronomy, being among the most promising sources of gravitational waves (GWs), and, at the same time, likely accompanied by a variety of electromagnetic counterparts across the entire spectrum, possibly including short gamma-ray bursts (SGRBs) and kilonova/macronova transients. Numerical relativity simulations play a central role in the study of these events. In particular, given the importance of magnetic fields, various aspects of this investigation require general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (GRMHD). So far, most GRMHD simulations focused the attention on BNS mergers leading to the formation of a hypermassive NS, which, in turn, collapses within few tens of ms into a black hole surrounded by an accretion disk. However, recent observations suggest that a significant fraction of these systems could form a long-lived NS remnant, which will either collapse on much longer timescales or remain indefinitely stable. Despite the profound implications for the evolution and the emission properties of the system, a detailed investigation of this alternative evolution channel is still missing. Here, we follow this direction and present a first detailed GRMHD study of BNS mergers forming a long-lived NS. We consider magnetized binaries with different mass ratios and equations of state and analyze the structure of the NS remnants, the rotation profiles, the accretion disks, the evolution and amplification of magnetic fields, and the ejection of matter. Moreover, we discuss the connection with the central engine of SGRBs and provide order-of-magnitude estimates for the kilonova/macronova signal. Finally, we study the GW emission, with particular attention to the post-merger phase.},

  abstract = {The observation of a radioactively powered kilonova associated with the first binary neutron star (BNS) merger detected in gravitational waves proved that these events are ideal sites for the production of heavy r-process elements. However, the physical origin of the ejected material responsible for the early (``blue'') and late (``red'') components of this kilonova is still debated. Here, we investigate the possibility that the early/blue kilonova originated from the magnetically driven baryon wind launched after merger by the metastable neutron star remnant. Exploiting a magnetized BNS merger simulation with over 250 ms of post-merger evolution, we can follow for the first time the full mass-ejection process up to its final decline. We find that the baryon wind carries {$\simeq$}0.010\textendash 0.028 M{$\odot$} of unbound material, proving that the high mass estimated for the blue kilonova can be achieved. We also find expansion velocities of up to {$\sim$}0.2c, consistent with the lower end of the observational estimates, and we discuss possible effects neglected here that could further increase the final ejecta velocity. Overall, our results show that the magnetically driven baryon wind represents a viable channel to explain the blue kilonova.},

  abstract = {We investigate \$r\$-process nucleosynthesis and kilonova emission resulting from binary neutron star (BNS) mergers based on a three-dimensional (3D) general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulation of a hypermassive neutron star (HMNS) remnant. The simulation includes a microphysical finite-temperature equation of state (EOS) and neutrino emission and absorption effects via a leakage scheme. We track the thermodynamic properties of the ejecta using Lagrangian tracer particles and determine its composition using the nuclear reaction network \$\textbackslash texttt\{SkyNet\}\$. We investigate the impact of neutrinos on the nucleosynthetic yields by varying the neutrino luminosities during post-processing. The ejecta show a broad distribution with respect to their electron fraction \$Y\_e\$, peaking between \$\textbackslash sim\$0.25-0.4 depending on the neutrino luminosity employed. We find that the resulting \$r\$-process abundance patterns differ from solar, with no significant production of material beyond the second \$r\$-process peak when using luminosities recorded by the tracer particles. We also map the HMNS outflows to the radiation hydrodynamics code \$\textbackslash texttt\{SNEC\}\$ and predict the evolution of the bolometric luminosity as well as broadband light curves of the kilonova. The bolometric light curve peaks on the timescale of a day and the brightest emission is seen in the infrared bands. This is the first direct calculation of the \$r\$-process yields and kilonova signal expected from HMNS winds based on 3D GRMHD simulations. For longer-lived remnants, these winds may be the dominant ejecta component producing the kilonova emission.},

Using a ray-tracing code to post-process data from a general relativistic 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulation, we generate images and spectra, and analyze the viewing angle dependence of the light emitted. When the accretion rate is relatively high, the circumbinary disk, accretion streams, and mini-disks combine to emit light in the UV/extreme-UV bands. We posit a thermal Compton hard X-ray spectrum for coronal emission; at high accretion rates, it is almost entirely produced in the mini-disks, but at lower accretion rates it is the primary radiation mechanism in the mini-disks and accretion streams as well. Due to relativistic beaming and gravitational lensing, the angular distribution of the power radiated is strongly anisotropic, especially near the equatorial plane.},

  abstract = {There is a broad consensus that accretion onto supermassive black holes and consequent jet formation power the observed emission from active galactic nuclei (AGNs). However, there has been less agreement about how jets form in accretion flows, their possible relationship to black hole spin, and how they interact with the surrounding medium. There have also been theoretical concerns about instabilities in standard accretion disk models and lingering discrepancies with observational constraints. Despite seemingly successful applications to X-ray binaries, the standard accretion disk model faces a growing list of observational constraints that challenge its application to AGNs. Theoretical exploration of these questions has become increasingly reliant on numerical simulations owing to the dynamic nature of these flows and the complex interplay between hydrodynamics, magnetic fields, radiation transfer, and curved spacetime. We conclude the following: {$\blacksquare$} The advent of general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) simulations has greatly improved our understanding of jet production and its dependence on black hole spin. {$\blacksquare$} Simulation results show both disks and jets are sensitive to the magnetic flux threading the accretion flow as well as possible misalignment between the angular momentum of the accretion flow and the black hole spin. {$\blacksquare$} Radiation MHD simulations are providing new insights into the stability of luminous accretion flows and highlighting the potential importance of radiation viscosity, UV opacity from atoms, and spiral density waves in AGNs.

  abstract = {Recently, particle in cell (PIC) simulations have shown that relativistic turbulence in collisionless plasmas can result in an equilibrium particle distribution function where turbulent heating is balanced by radiative cooling of electrons. Strongly magnetized plasmas are characterized by higher energy peaks and broader particle distributions. In relativistically moving astrophysical jets, it is believed that the flow is launched Poynting flux dominated and that the resulting magnetic instabilities may create a turbulent environment inside the jet, i.e., the regime of relativistic turbulence. In this paper, we extend previous PIC simulation results to larger values of plasma magnetization by linearly extrapolating the diffusion and advection coefficients relevant for the turbulent plasmas under consideration. We use these results to build a single zone turbulent jet model that is based on the global parameters of blazar emission region, and consistently calculate the particle distribution and resulting synchrotron and inverse Compton emission spectra. We then test our model by comparing its predictions with the broad-band quiescent emission spectra of a dozen blazars. Our results show good agreement with observations of low-synchrotron peaked (LSP) sources and find that LSPs are moderately Poynting flux dominated with magnetization \$1\textbackslash lesssim \textbackslash sigma \textbackslash lesssim 5\$, have bulk Lorentz factor \$\textbackslash Gamma\textbackslash sim 10-30\$, and that the turbulent region is located at the edge, or just beyond, the broad line region (BLR). The turbulence is found to be driven at an area comparable to the jet cross section.},

  abstract = {The merger of two neutron stars or a neutron star and a black hole typically results in the formation of a postmerger accretion disk. Outflows from disks may dominate the overall ejecta from mergers and be a major source of r-process nuclei in our universe. We explore the parameter space of such disks and their outflows and r-process yields by performing 3D general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations with weak interactions and approximate neutrino transport. We discuss the mapping between the initial binary parameters and the parameter space of the resulting disks, chiefly characterized by their initial accretion rate. We demonstrate the existence of an ignition threshold for weak interactions at around {$\sim$}10-3 M {$\odot$} s-1 for typical parameters by means of analytic calculations and numerical simulations. We find a degenerate, self-regulated, neutrino-cooled regime above the threshold and an advection-dominated regime below the threshold. Excess heating in the absence of neutrino cooling below the threshold leads to {$\greaterequivlnt$}60\% of the initial disk mass being ejected in outflows, with typical velocities of {$\sim$}(0.1\textendash 0.2)c, compared to {$\lessequivlnt$}40\% at {$\sim$}(0.1\textendash 0.15)c above the threshold. While disks below the threshold show suppressed production of light r-process elements, disks above the threshold can produce the entire range of r-process elements, in good agreement with the observed solar system abundances. Disks below the ignition threshold may produce an overabundance of actinides seen in actinide-boost stars. As gravitational-wave detectors start to sample the neutron star merger parameter space, different disk realizations may be observable via their associated kilonova emission.},

  abstract = {We examine the effect of spatial resolution on initial mass ejection in grid-based hydrodynamic simulations of binary neutron star mergers. The subset of the dynamical ejecta with velocities greater than {$\sim$}0.6c can generate an ultraviolet precursor to the kilonova on approximately hour timescales and contribute to a years long nonthermal afterglow. Previous work has found differing amounts of this fast ejecta, by one to two orders of magnitude, when using particle-based or grid-based hydrodynamic methods. Here, we carry out a numerical experiment that models the merger as an axisymmetric collision in a corotating frame, accounting for Newtonian self-gravity, inertial forces, and gravitational wave losses. The lower computational cost allows us to reach spatial resolutions as high as 4 m, or {$\sim$}3 \texttimes{} 10-4 of the stellar radius. We find that fast ejecta production converges to within 10\% for a cell size of 20 m. This suggests that fast ejecta quantities found in existing grid-based merger simulations are unlikely to increase to the level needed to match particle-based results upon further resolution increases. The resulting neutron-powered precursors are in principle detectable out to distances {$\lessequivlnt$}200 Mpc with upcoming facilities.We also find that head-on collisions at the freefall speed, relevant for eccentric mergers, yield fast and slow ejecta quantities of order 10-2 M {$\odot$}, with a kilonova signature distinct from that of quasi-circular mergers.},

  abstract = {Context. Stars and their winds can contribute to the non-thermal  emission in extragalactic jets. Because of the complexity of jet-star interactions, the properties of the resulting emission are closely linked to those of the emitting flows. Aims: We simulate the interaction between a stellar wind and a relativistic extragalactic jet and use the hydrodynamic results to compute the non-thermal emission under different conditions. Methods: We performed relativistic axisymmetric hydrodynamical simulations of a relativistic jet interacting with a supersonic, non-relativistic stellar wind. We computed the corresponding streamlines out of the simulation results and calculated the injection, evolution, and emission of non-thermal particles accelerated in the jet shock, focusing on electrons or e{$\pm$}-pairs. Several cases were explored, considering different jet-star interaction locations, magnetic fields, and observer lines of sight. The jet luminosity and star properties were fixed, but the results are easily scalable when these parameters are changed. Results: Individual jet-star interactions produce synchrotron and inverse Compton emission that peaks from X-rays to MeV energies (depending on the magnetic field), and at \textasciitilde 100-1000 GeV (depending on the stellar type), respectively. The radiation spectrum is hard in the scenarios explored here as a result of non-radiative cooling dominance, as low-energy electrons are efficiently advected even under relatively high magnetic fields. Interactions of jets with cold stars lead to an even harder inverse Compton spectrum because of the Klein-Nishina effect in the cross section. Doppler boosting has a strong effect on the observer luminosity. Conclusions: The emission levels for individual interactions found here are in the line of previous, more approximate, estimates, strengthening the hypothesis that collective jet-star interactions could significantly contribute at high energies under efficient particle acceleration.},

  abstract = {Context. Binaries hosting a massive star and a non-accreting pulsar are  powerful non-thermal emitters owing to the interaction of the pulsar and the stellar wind. The winds of massive stars are thought to be inhomogeneous, which could have an impact on the non-thermal emission.  Aims: We study numerically the impact of the presence of inhomogeneities or clumps in the stellar wind on the high-energy non-thermal radiation of high-mass binaries hosting a non-accreting pulsar. Methods: We compute the trajectories and physical properties of the streamlines in the shocked pulsar wind without clumps, with a small clump, and with a large clump. This information is used to characterize the injection and the steady state distribution of non-thermal particles accelerated at shocks formed in the pulsar wind. The synchrotron and inverse Compton emission from these non-thermal particles is calculated, accounting also for the effect of gamma-ray absorption through pair creation. A specific study is done for PSR B1259-63/LS2883. Results: When stellar wind clumps perturb the two-wind interaction region, the associated non-thermal radiation in the X-ray band, of synchrotron origin, and in the GeV-TeV band, of inverse Compton origin, is affected by several equally important effects: (I) strong changes in the plasma velocity direction that result in Doppler boosting factor variations; (II) strengthening of the magnetic field that mainly enhances the synchrotron radiation; (III) strengthening of the pulsar wind kinetic energy dissipation at the shock, potentially available for particle acceleration; and (iv) changes in the rate of adiabatic losses that affect the lower energy part of the non-thermal particle population. The radiation above 100 GeV detected, presumably, during the post-periastron crossing of the Be star disc in PSR B1259-63/LS2883, can be roughly reproduced assuming that the crossing of the disc is modelled as the encounter with a large inhomogeneity.  Conclusions: Because of the likely diverse nature of clumps in the stellar wind, and hydrodynamical instabilities, the non-thermal radiation of high-mass binaries with a non-accreting pulsar is expected to be boosted somewhat chaotically, and to present different superimposed variability patterns. Some of the observed variability in gamma rays from PSR B1259-63/LS2883 is qualitatively reproduced by our calculations.},

  abstract = {Context. Recently, the colliding-wind region of the binary stellar  system HD 93129A was resolved for the first time using Very Large Baseline Interferometry. This system, one of the most massive known binaries in our Galaxy, presents non-thermal emission in the radio band, which can be used to infer the physical conditions in the system, and make predictions for the high-energy band. Aims: We intend to constrain some of the unknown parameters of HD 93129A through modeling the non-thermal emitter. We also aim to analyse the detectability of this source in hard X-rays and {$\gamma$}-rays. Finally, we want to predict how the non-thermal emission will evolve in the future, when the stars approach periastron. Methods: A broadband radiative model for the wind-collision region (WCR) has been developed taking into account the evolution of the accelerated particles streaming along the shocked region, the emission by different radiative processes, and the attenuation of the emission propagating through the local matter and radiation fields. We reproduce the available radio data, and make predictions of the emission in hard X-rays and {$\gamma$}-rays under different assumptions. Results: From the analysis of the radio emission, we find that the binary HD 93129A is more likely to have a low inclination and a high eccentricity, with the more massive star being currently closer to the observer. The minimum energy of the non-thermal electrons seems to be between \textasciitilde 20-100 MeV, depending on the intensity of the magnetic field in the WCR. The latter can be in the range \textasciitilde 20-1500 mG. Conclusions: Our model is able to reproduce the observed radio emission, and predicts that the non-thermal radiation from HD 93129A will increase in the near future. With instruments such as NuSTAR, Fermi, and CTA, it will be possible to constrain the relativistic particle content of the source, and other parameters such as the magnetic field strength in the WCR which, in turn, can be used to obtain upper-limits of the magnetic field on the surface of the very massive stars, thereby inferring whether magnetic field amplification is taking place in the particle acceleration region.},

  abstract = {The quest for binary and dual supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at the dawn of the multi-messenger era is compelling. Detecting dual active galactic nuclei (AGN) \textendash{} active SMBHs at projected separations larger than several parsecs \textendash{} and binary AGN \textendash{} probing the scale where SMBHs are bound in a Keplerian binary \textendash{} is an observational challenge. The study of AGN pairs (either dual or binary) also represents an overarching theoretical problem in cosmology and astrophysics. The AGN triggering calls for detailed knowledge of the hydrodynamical conditions of gas in the imminent surroundings of the SMBHs and, at the same time, their duality calls for detailed knowledge on how galaxies assemble through major and minor mergers and grow fed by matter along the filaments of the cosmic web. This review describes the techniques used across the electromagnetic spectrum to detect dual and binary AGN candidates and proposes new avenues for their search. The current observational status is compared with the state-of-the-art numerical simulations and models for formation of dual and binary AGN. Binary SMBHs are among the loudest sources of gravitational waves (GWs) in the Universe. The search for a background of GWs at nHz frequencies from inspiralling SMBHs at low redshifts, and the direct detection of signals from their coalescence by the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna in the next decade, make this a theme of major interest for multi-messenger astrophysics. This review discusses the future facilities and observational strategies that are likely to significantly advance this fascinating field.},

We study four models with increasing black hole spin, from a/M=0 to 0.998, for which the structural parameters of the initial tori are maintained nearly constant. The subsequent accretion flows arise self-consistently from stresses and turbulence created by the magnetorotational instability. We investigate the overall evolution and the late-time global structure in the resulting nonradiative accretion flows, including the magnetic fields within the disks, the properties of the flow in the plunging region, and the flux of conserved quantities into the black hole. Independent of black hole spin, the global structure is described in terms of five regions: the main disk body, the coronal envelope, the inner disk (consisting of an inner torus and plunging region), an evacuated axial funnel, and a biconical outflow confined to the corona-funnel boundary. We find evidence for lower accretion rates, stronger funnel-wall outflows, and increased stress in the near-hole region with increasing black hole spin.},

In this paper we focus on the unbound outflows that emerge self-consistently from the accretion flow. These outflows are found in the axial funnel region and consist of two components: a hot, fast, tenuous outflow in the axial funnel proper and a colder, slower, denser jet along the funnel wall. The funnel-wall jet is excluded from the axial funnel by elevated angular momentum and is also pressure-confined by a magnetized corona. Inside the funnel, a largescale poloidal magnetic field spontaneously arises from the coupled dynamics of accretion and outflow, although there was no large-scale field in the initial state. Black hole rotation is not required to produce these unbound outflows, but their strength is enhanced by black hole spin. When the black hole spins rapidly, the energy ejected can be tens of percent of the accreted rest mass. At low spin, kinetic energy and enthalpy of the matter dominate the outflow energetics; at high spin, the balance shifts to Poynting flux. We compare the outflows observed in our simulations with those seen in other simulations.},

  abstract = {Nearly 150 massive black hole binary (MBHB) candidates at sub-pc orbital separations have been reported in recent literature. Nevertheless, the definitive detection of even a single such object remains elusive. If at least one of the black holes is accreting, the light emitted from its accretion disc will be lensed by the other black hole for binary orbital inclinations near to the line of sight. This binary self-lensing could provide a unique signature of compact MBHB systems. We show that, for MBHBs with masses in the range 10\^6 - 10\^10 solar masses and with orbital periods less than \textasciitilde 10 yr, strong lensing events should occur in one to 10s of percent of MBHB systems that are monitored for an entire orbit. Lensing events will last from days for the less massive, shorter period MBHBs up to a year for the most massive \textasciitilde 10 year orbital period MBHBs. At small inclinations of the binary orbit to the line of sight, lensing must occur and will be accompanied by periodicity due to the relativistic Doppler boost. Flares at the same phase as the otherwise average flux of the Doppler modulation would be a smoking gun signature of self-lensing and can be used to constrain binary parameters. For MBHBs with separation {$>$}100 Schwarzschild radii, we show that finite-sized source effects could serve as a probe of MBH accretion disc structure. Finally, we stress that our lensing probability estimate implies that \textasciitilde 10 of the known MBHB candidates identified through quasar periodicity should exhibit strong lensing flares.},

  abstract = {Relativistic jets in active galactic nuclei (AGN) convert as much as half of their energy into radiation. To explore the poorly understood processes that are responsible for this conversion, we carry out fully 3D magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of relativistic magnetized jets. Unlike the standard approach of injecting the jets at large radii, our simulated jets self-consistently form at the source and propagate and accelerate outward for several orders of magnitude in distance before they interact with the ambient medium. We find that this interaction can trigger strong energy dissipation of two kinds inside the jets, depending on the properties of the ambient medium. Those jets that form in a new outburst and drill a fresh hole through the ambient medium fall victim to a 3D magnetic kink instability and dissipate their energy primarily through magnetic reconnection in the current sheets formed by the instability. On the other hand, those jets that form during repeated cycles of AGN activity and escape through a pre-existing hole in the ambient medium maintain their stability and dissipate their energy primarily at MHD recollimation shocks. In both cases the dissipation region can be associated with a change in the density profile of the ambient gas. The Bondi radius in AGN jets serves as such a location.},

  abstract = {Starting as highly relativistic collimated jets, gamma-ray burst outflows gradually slow down and become nonrelativistic spherical blast waves. Although detailed analytical solutions describing the afterglow emission received by an on-axis observer during both the early and late phases of the outflow evolution exist, a calculation of the received flux during the intermediate phase and for an off-axis observer requires either a more simplified analytical model or direct numerical simulations of the outflow dynamics. In this paper, we present light curves for off-axis observers covering the long-term evolution of the blast wave, calculated from a high-resolution two-dimensional relativistic hydrodynamics simulation using a synchrotron radiation model. We compare our results to earlier analytical work and calculate the consequence of the observer angle with respect to the jet axis both for the detection of orphan afterglows and for jet break fits to the observational data. We confirm earlier results in the literature finding that only a very small number of local type Ibc supernovae can harbor an orphan afterglow. For off-axis observers, the observable jet break can be delayed up to several weeks, potentially leading to overestimation of the beaming-corrected total energy. In addition we find that, when using our off-axis light curves to create synthetic Swift X-ray data, jet breaks are likely to remain hidden in the data.},

  abstract = {This paper sets out a moderate version of metaphysical structural realism that stands in contrast to both the epistemic structural realism of Worrall and the\textemdash radical\textemdash ontic structural realism of French and Ladyman. According to moderate structural realism, objects and relations (structure) are on the same ontological footing, with the objects being characterized only by the relations in which they stand. We show how this position fares well as regards philosophical arguments, avoiding the objections against the other two versions of structural realism. In particular, we set out how this position can be applied to space-time, providing for a convincing understanding of space-time points in the standard tensor formulation of general relativity as well as in the fibre bundle formulation.},

  abstract = {Simultaneous gravitational and electromagnetic wave observations of merging black hole binaries (BHBHs) can provide unique opportunities to study gravitation physics, accretion and cosmology. Here we perform fully general relativistic, hydrodynamic simulations of equal-mass, nonspinning BHBHs coalescing in a circumbinary disk. We evolve the metric using the Baumgarte-Shapiro-Shibata-Nakamura (BSSN) formulation of Einstein's field equations with standard moving puncture gauge conditions. We handle the hydrodynamics via a high-resolution shock-capturing (HRSC) scheme. We track the inspiral starting from a binary separation of 10M, where M is the total binary mass. We take the disks to have an inner radius at R\_in\textasciitilde 15M to account for the hollow created by the binary torques. Our disks extend to R=65M and have an initial scale height of H/R=0.03-0.11. The gas is governed by a Gamma-law EOS, with Gamma equal to 5/3, 4/3, and 1.1. Disks are allowed to relax in the "early inspiral" epoch to provide quasistationary realistic initial data. We then evolve the metric and matter during the "late inspiral and merger" epoch. The later simulations are designed to track BHBH inspiral following disk-binary decoupling, through merger and ringdown, terminating before viscosity has time to fill the hollow about the remnant. We compute the gas flow and accretion rate and estimate the electromagnetic luminosity due to bremsstrahlung and synchrotron emission as a perturbation for optically thin disks. The synchrotron component of the luminosity peaks in the infrared band and should be detectable by WFIRST and possibly the LSST for a 10\^8 M\_sun binary embedded in a disk with a density n\textasciitilde 10\^12/cm\^3 at z=1, beginning with a maximum value of \$L\textasciitilde 10\^46 n\_12\^2 M\_8\^3 erg/s at decoupling, and decreasing steadily over a timescale of \textasciitilde 100 M\_8 hours to a value of L\textasciitilde 10\^45 n\_12\^2 M\_8\^3 erg/s at merger.},

For black holes maximally spinning this corresponds to 2.5PN order. Our result for the equations of motion essentially confirms the previous result by Tagoshi, Ohashi and Owen. We also compute the spin-orbit effects up to 2.5PN order in the conserved (Noetherian) integrals of motion, namely the energy, the total angular momentum, the linear momentum and the center-of-mass integral. We obtain the spin precession equations at 1PN order beyond the leading term, as well. Those results will be used in a future paper to derive the time evolution of the binary orbital phase, providing more accurate templates for LIGO-Virgo-LISA type interferometric detectors.},

  abstract = {On one popular view, the general covariance of gravity implies that change is relational in a strong sense, such that all it is for a physical degree of freedom to change is for it to vary with regard to a second physical degree of freedom. At a quantum level, this view of "change as relative variation" leads to a "fundamentally timeless" formalism for quantum gravity. Here, we will show how one may avoid this acute `problem of time'. Under our view, duration is still regarded as relative, but temporal succession is taken to be absolute. Following our approach, which is presented in more formal terms in arXiv:1303.7139, it is possible to conceive of a genuinely dynamical theory of quantum gravity within which time, in a substantive sense, remains.},

  abstract = {Quasars whose broad emission lines show temporal, bulk radial velocity (RV) shifts have been proposed as candidate sub-parsec (sub-pc), binary supermassive black holes (BSBHs). We identified a sample of 16 BSBH candidates based on two-epoch spectroscopy among 52 quasars with significant RV shifts over a few rest-frame years. The candidates showed consistent velocity shifts independently measured from two broad lines (H{$\beta$} and H{$\alpha$} or Mg\,ii) without significant changes in the broad-line profiles. Here in the third paper of the series, we present further third- and fourth-epoch spectroscopy for 12 of the 16 candidates for continued RV tests, spanning {$\sim$}5\textendash 15~yr in the quasars' rest frames. Cross-correlation analysis of the broad H{$\beta$} calibrated against [O\,iii]\,{$\lambda$}5007 suggests that five of the 12 quasars remain valid as BSBH candidates. They show broad H{$\beta$} RV curves that are consistent with binary orbital motion without significant changes in the broad-line profiles. Their broad H{$\alpha$} (or Mg\,ii) lines display RV shifts that are either consistent with or smaller than those seen in broad H{$\beta$}. The RV shifts can be explained by an {$\sim$}0.05\textendash 0.1~pc BSBH with an orbital period of {$\sim$}40\textendash 130~yr, assuming a mass ratio of 0.5\textendash 2 and a circular orbit. However, the parameters are not well constrained given the few epochs that sample only a small portion of the hypothesized binary orbital cycle. The apparent occurrence rate of sub-pc BSBHs is {$\lessequivlnt$}13~{$\pm~$}5~per\,cent among all SDSS quasars, with no significant difference in the subsets with and without single-epoch broad-line velocity offsets. Dedicated long-term spectroscopic monitoring is still needed to further confirm or reject these BSBH candidates.},

We use the code Bothros to post-process data from 3D General Relativistic Magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations via ray-tracing calculations. These simulations model the dynamics of a circumbinary disk and the mini-disks that form around two equal-mass black holes orbiting each other at an initial separation of 20 gravitational radii, and evolve the system for more than 10 orbits in the inspiral regime. We model the emission as the sum of thermal blackbody radiation emitted by an optically thick accretion disk and a power-law spectrum extending to hard X-rays emitted by a hot optically thin corona. We generate time-dependent spectra, images, and light curves at various frequencies to investigate intrinsic periodic signals in the emission, as well as the effects of the black hole spin. We find that prograde black hole spin makes mini-disks brighter since the smaller ISCO angular momentum demands more dissipation before matter plunges to the horizon. However, compared to mini-disks in larger separation binaries with spinning black holes, our mini-disks are less luminous: unlike those systems, their mass accretion rate is lower than in the circumbinary disk, and they radiate with lower efficiency because their inflow times are shorter. Finally, we discuss the implications of our findings for the potential observability of these systems.},

  abstract = {We compute a series of three-dimensional general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of accretion flows in the Kerr metric to investigate the properties of the unbound outflows that result. The overall strength of these outflows increases sharply with increasing black hole rotation rate, but a number of generic features are found in all cases. The mass in the outflow is concentrated in a hollow cone whose opening angle is largely determined by the effective potential for matter orbiting with angular momentum comparable to that of the innermost stable circular orbit. The dominant force accelerating the matter outward comes from the pressure of the accretion disk's corona. The principal element that shapes the outflow is therefore the centrifugal barrier preventing accreting matter from coming close to the rotation axis. Inside the centrifugal barrier, the cone contains very little matter and is dominated by electromagnetic fields that rotate at a rate tied closely to the rotation of the black hole. These fields carry an outward-going Poynting flux whose immediate energy source is the rotating spacetime of the Kerr black hole. When the spin parameter a/M of the black hole exceeds \textasciitilde 0.9, the energy carried to infinity by these outflows can be comparable to the nominal radiative efficiency predicted in the Novikov-Thorne model. Similarly, the expelled angular momentum can be comparable to that accreted by the black hole. Both the inner electromagnetic part and the outer matter part can contribute in significant fashion to the energy and angular momentum of the outflow.},

The kinetic energy of this fast tail is {$\sim$}1047\textendash 1049 erg, depending on the neutron star equation of state and on the binary masses. The synchrotron flare arising from the interaction of this fast tail with the surrounding interstellar medium (ISM) can power the observed nonthermal emission that followed GW170817, provided that the ISM density is \textasciitilde 10-2 cm-3, the two neutron stars had roughly equal masses and the neutron star equation of state is soft (small neutron star radii). One of the generic predictions of this scenario is that the cooling frequency crosses the X-ray band on a timescale of a few months to a year, leading to a cooling break in the X-ray light curve. While the recent observation of the superluminal motion resolved by very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) rules out the dynamical ejecta scenario, the model described in this paper is generic and can be applied for future neutron star merger events.},

Thermalization of charged decay products, i.e., electrons, {$\alpha$}-particles, and fission fragments, is calculated according to their injection energy. The {$\gamma$}-ray thermalization processes are also properly calculated by taking the {$\gamma$}-ray spectrum of each decay into account. We show that the {$\beta$}-decay heating rate at later times approaches a power-law decline as {$\propto$}t-2.8, which agrees with the result of Waxman et al. We present a new analytic model to calculate macronova light curves, in which the density structure of the ejecta is accounted for. We demonstrate that the observed bolometric light curve and temperature evolution of the macronova associated with GW170817 are reproduced well by the {$\beta$}-decay heating rate with the solar r-process abundance pattern. We interpret the break in the observed bolometric light curve around a week as a result of the diffusion wave crossing a significant part of the ejecta rather than a thermalization break. We also show that the time-weighted integral of the bolometric light curve (Katz integral) is useful to provide an estimate of the total r-process mass from the observed data, which is independent of the highly uncertain radiative transfer. For the macronova in GW170817, the ejecta mass is robustly estimated as {$\approx$}0.05 M{$\odot$} for Amin {$\leq$} 72 and 85 {$\leq$} Amin {$\leq$} 130 with the solar r-process abundance pattern. The code for computation of the heating rate and light curve for given initial nuclear abundances is publicly available.},

  abstract = {(Abridged) By asymptotically matching a post-Newtonian (PN) metric to two tidally perturbed Schwarzschild metrics, we generate approximate initial data (in the form of a 4-metric) for a nonspinning black hole binary in a circular orbit. We carry out this matching through O(v\^4) in the binary's orbital velocity v, so the resulting data are conformally curved. Far from the holes, we use the appropriate PN metric that accounts for retardation, which we construct using the highest-order PN expressions available to compute the binary's past history. The data set's uncontrolled remainders are thus O(v\^5) throughout the timeslice; we also generate an extension to the data set that has uncontrolled remainders of O(v\^6) in the purely PN portion of the timeslice (i.e., not too close to the holes). The resulting data are smooth, since we join all the metrics together by smoothly interpolating between them. We perform this interpolation using transition functions constructed to avoid introducing excessive additional constraint violations. Due to their inclusion of tidal deformations and outgoing radiation, these data should substantially reduce the initial spurious ("junk") radiation observed in current simulations that use conformally flat initial data. Such reductions in the nonphysical components of the initial data will be necessary for simulations to achieve the accuracy required to supply Advanced LIGO and LISA with the templates necessary for parameter estimation.},

  abstract = {We present results from the first global 3D MHD simulations of accretion disks in cataclysmic variable (CV) systems in order to investigate the relative importance of angular momentum transport via turbulence driven by the magnetorotational instability (MRI) compared with that driven by spiral shock waves. Remarkably, we find that even with vigorous MRI turbulence, spiral shocks are an important component of the overall angular momentum budget, at least when temperatures in the disk are high (so that Mach numbers are low). In order to understand the excitation, propagation, and damping of spiral density waves in our simulations more carefully, we perform a series of 2D global hydrodynamical simulations with various equation of states, both with and without mass inflow via the Lagrangian point (L1). Compared with previous similar studies, we find the following new results. (1) The linear wave dispersion relation fits the pitch angles of spiral density waves very well. (2) We demonstrate explicitly that mass accretion is driven by the deposition of negative angular momentum carried by the waves when they dissipate in shocks. (3) Using Reynolds stress scaled by gas pressure to represent the effective angular momentum transport rate aeff is not accurate when mass accretion is driven by non-axisymmetric shocks. (4) Using the mass accretion rate measured in our simulations to directly measure {$\alpha$} defined in standard thin-disk theory, we find 0.02  aeff  0.05 for CV disks, consistent with observed values in quiescent states of dwarf novae. In this regime, the disk may be too cool and neutral for the MRI to operate and spiral shocks are a possible accretion mechanism. However, we caution that our simulations use unrealistically low Mach numbers in this regime and, therefore, future models with more realistic thermodynamics and non-ideal MHD are warranted.},

  abstract = {The ubiquitous relativistic jet phenomena associated with black holes play a major role in high and very-high-energy (VHE) astrophysics. In particular, observations have demonstrated that blazars show VHE emission with time-variability from days (in the GeV band) to minutes (in the TeV band), implying very compact emission regions. The real mechanism able to explain the particle acceleration process responsible for this emission is still debated, but magnetic reconnection has been lately discussed as a strong potential candidate and, in some circumstances, as the only possible one. In this work, we present the results of three-dimensional special relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the development of reconnection events driven by turbulence induced by current-driven kink instability along a relativistic jet. We have performed a systematic identification of all reconnection regions in the system, characterizing their local magnetic field topology and quantifying the reconnection rates. We obtained average rates of \$0.051\textbackslash pm0.026\$ (in units of the Alfv\textbackslash '\{e\}n speed) which are comparable to the predictions of the theory of turbulence-induced fast reconnection. Detailed statistical analysis also demonstrated that the fast reconnection events follow a log-normal distribution, which is a signature of its turbulent origin. To probe the robustness of our method, we have applied our results to the blazar Mrk 421. Building a synthetic light curve from the integrated power of the magnetic reconnection events, we evaluated the time-variability from a power spectral density analysis, obtaining a good agreement with the observations in the GeV band. This suggests that turbulent fast magnetic reconnection driven by kink instability can be a possible process behind the high energy emission variability phenomena observed in blazars.},

  abstract = {Massive black hole (MBH) binaries, which are expected to form following the merger of their parent galaxies, produce gravitational waves that will be detectable by pulsar timing arrays at nanohertz frequencies (year periods). While no confirmed, compact MBH binary systems have been seen in electromagnetic observations, a large number of candidates have recently been identified in optical surveys of active galactic nucleus (AGN) variability. Using a combination of cosmological, hydrodynamic simulations; comprehensive, semi-analytic binary merger models; and analytic AGN spectra and variability prescriptions; we calculate the expected electromagnetic detection rates of MBH binaries as periodically variable AGN. In particular, we consider two independent variability models: (i) Doppler boosting due to large orbital velocities and (ii) hydrodynamic variability in which the fuelling of MBH accretion discs is periodically modulated by the companion. Our models predict that numerous MBH binaries should be present and distinguishable in the existing data. In particular, our fiducial models produce an expectation value of 0.2 (Doppler) and 5 (hydrodynamic) binaries to be identifiable in the Catalina survey (CRTS), while 20 and 100 are expected after 5 yr of LSST observations. The brightness variations in most systems are too small to be distinguishable, but almost \$1\{\{\textbackslash{} \textbackslash rm per\textbackslash{} cent\}\}\$ of AGN at redshifts \$z\$ {$\lessequivlnt$} 0.6 could be in massive binaries. We analyse the predicted binary parameters of observable systems and their selection biases, and include an extensive discussion of our model parameters and uncertainties.},

  abstract = {This thesis studies the populations and dynamics of massive black-hole binaries and their mergers, and explores the implications for electromagnetic and gravitational-wave signals that will be detected in the near future. Massive black-holes (MBH) reside in the centers of galaxies, and when galaxies merge, their MBH interact and often pair together. We base our study on the populations of MBH and galaxies from the `Illustris' cosmological hydrodynamic simulations. The bulk of the binary merger dynamics, however, are unresolved in cosmological simulations. We implement a suite of comprehensive physical models for the merger process, like dynamical friction and gravitational wave emission, which are added in postprocessing. Contrary to many previous studies, we find that the most massive binaries with near equalmass companions are the most efficient at coalescing; though the process still typically takes gigayears. From the data produced by these MBH binary populations and their dynamics, we calculate the expected gravitational wave (GW) signals: both the stochastic, GW background of countless unresolved sources, and the GW foreground of individually resolvable binaries which resound above the noise. Ongoing experiments, called pulsar timing arrays, are sensitive to both of these types of signals. We find that, while the current lack of detections is unsurprising, both the background and foreground will plausibly be detected in the next decade. Unlike previous studies which have predicted the foreground to be significantly harder to detect than the background, we find their typical amplitudes are comparable. With traditional electromagnetic observations, there has also been a dearth of confirmed detections of MBH binary systems. We use our binaries, combined with models of emission from accreting MBH systems, to make predictions for the occurrence rate of systems observable using photometric, periodicvariability surveys. These variables should be detectable in current surveys, and indeed, we expect many candidates recently identified to be true binaries - though a significant fraction are likely false positives. Overall, this thesis finds the science of MBH binaries at an exciting cusp: just before incredible breakthroughs in observations, both electromagnetically and in the new age of gravitational wave astrophysics.},

  abstract = {Binary black hole (BBH) mergers provide a prime source for current and future interferometric GW observatories. Massive BBH mergers may often take place in plasma-rich environments, leading to the exciting possibility of a concurrent electromagnetic (EM) signal observable by traditional astronomical facilities. However, many critical questions about the generation of such counterparts remain unanswered. We explore mechanisms that may drive EM counterparts with magnetohydrodynamic simulations treating a range of scenarios involving equal-mass black-hole binaries immersed in an initially homogeneous fluid with uniform, orbitally aligned magnetic fields. We find that the time development of Poynting luminosity, which may drive jet-like emissions, is relatively insensitive to aspects of the initial configuration. In particular, over a significant range of initial values, the central magnetic field strength is effectively regulated by the gas flow to yield a Poynting luminosity of \$10\^\{45\}-10\^\{46\} \textbackslash rho\_\{-13\} M\_8\^2 \textbackslash, \{\textbackslash rm erg\}\textbackslash,\{\textbackslash rm s\}\^\{-1\}\$, with BBH mass scaled to \$M\_8 \textbackslash equiv M/(10\^8 M\_\{\textbackslash odot\})\$ and ambient density \$\textbackslash rho\_\{-13\} \textbackslash equiv \textbackslash rho/(10\^\{-13\} \textbackslash, \{\textbackslash rm g\} \textbackslash, \{\textbackslash rm cm\}\^\{-3\})\$. We also calculate the direct plasma synchrotron emissions processed through geodesic ray-tracing. Despite lensing effects and dynamics, we find the observed synchrotron flux varies little leading up to merger.},

  abstract = {The inverse Compton (IC) scattering of ultrarelativistic electrons accelerated at the pulsar wind termination shock is generally believed to be responsible for TeV gamma-ray signal recently reported from the binary system PSR B1259-63/SS2883. While this process can explain the energy spectrum of the observed TeV emission, the gamma-ray fluxes detected by the Array of Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (HESS) at different epochs do not agree with the published theoretical predictions of the TeV light curve. The main objective of this paper is to show that the HESS results can be explained, under certain reasonable assumptions concerning the cooling of relativistic electrons, by IC scenarios of gamma-ray production in PSR B1259-63. In this paper we study evolution of the energy spectra of relativistic electrons under different assumptions about the acceleration and energy-loss rates of electrons, and the impact of these processes on the light curve of IC gamma-rays. We demonstrate that the observed TeV light curve can be explained (i) by adiabatic losses which dominate over the entire trajectory of the pulsar with a significant increase towards the periastron or (ii) by the `early' (sub-TeV) cut-offs in the energy spectra of electrons due to the enhanced rate of Compton losses close to the periastron. The first four data points obtained just after periastron comprise an exception - possibly due to interaction with the Be star disc, which introduces additional physics not included in the presented model. The calculated spectral and temporal characteristics of the TeV radiation provide conclusive tests to distinguish between these two working hypotheses. The Compton deceleration of the electron-positron pulsar wind contributes to the decrease of the non-thermal power released in the accelerated electrons after the wind termination, and thus to the reduction of the IC and synchrotron components of radiation close to the periastron. Although this effect alone cannot explain the observed TeV and X-ray light curves, the Comptonization of the cold ultrarelativistic wind leads to the formation of gamma-radiation with a specific line-type energy spectrum. While the HESS data already constrain the Lorentz factor of the wind, {$\Gamma$} {$<$}= 106 (for the most likely orbit inclination angle i = 35\textdegree, and assuming an isotropic pulsar wind), future observations of this object with GLAST should allow a deep probe of the wind Lorentz factor in the range between 104 and 106.},

We study cases in which the Keplerian accretion disk is both corotating and counterrotating with respect to the black hole rotation, and investigate the \DH rst D50 light-crossing times. In the corotating disk case, our results are almost the same as those in Schwarzschild black hole cases : a gas pressure\`Edriven jet is formed by a shock in the disk, and a weaker magnetically driven jet is also generated outside the gas pressure\`Edriven jet. On the other hand, in the counter-rotating disk case, a new powerful magnetically driven jet is formed inside the gas pressure\`Edriven jet. The newly found magnetically driven jet in the latter case is accelerated by a strong magnetic \DH eld created by frame dragging in the ergosphere. Through this process, the magnetic \DH eld extracts the energy of the black hole rotation.},

  abstract = {The time-dependent general relativistic equations of degenerate electrodynamics are solved numerically in order to study the mechanism of the electromagnetic extraction of the rotational energy of black holes. We performed a series of 2D runs for black holes with specific angular momentum, a, from 0.1 to 0.9 and for a monopole magnetic field assuming axisymmetry. In the inner region of the wind, the solution quickly settles to a steady state with an outgoing Poynting flux. In all cases the angular velocity of the magnetic field lines is almost half the angular velocity of the black hole. Thus, at least for the configuration considered, the Blandford \textendash Znajek mechanism operates near its maximum power output.},

  abstract = {The main goal of this research is to get better insights into the properties of the plasma-filled magnetospheres of black holes by means of direct numerical simulations and, ultimately, to resolve the controversy surrounding the Blandford\textendash Znajek mechanism. Driven by the need to write the equations of black hole electrodynamics in a form convenient for numerical applications, we constructed a new system of 3 + 1 equations, which not only has a more traditional form than the now classic 3 + 1 system of Thorne and Macdonald but also is more general. To deal with the magnetospheric current sheets, we also developed a simple model of radiative resistivity based on the inverse Compton scattering of background photons. The results of numerical simulations combined with simple analytical arguments allow us to make a number of important conclusions on the nature of the Blandford\textendash Znajek mechanism. We show that, just like in the Penrose mechanism and in the magnetohydrodynamic models of Punsly and Coroniti, the key role in this mechanism is played by the black hole ergosphere. The poloidal currents are driven by the gravitationally induced electric field, which cannot be screened within the ergosphere by any static distribution of the electric charge of locally created pair plasma. Contrary to what is expected in the membrane paradigm, the energy and angular momentum are extracted not only along the magnetic field lines penetrating the event horizon but also along all field lines penetrating the ergosphere. In dipolar magnetic configurations symmetric relative to the equatorial plane, the force-free approximation breaks down within the ergosphere, where a strong current sheet develops along the equatorial plane. This current sheet supplies energy and angular momentum at infinity to the surrounding force-free magnetosphere. The Blandford\textendash Znajek monopole solution is found to be asymptotically stable and causal. The so-called horizon boundary condition of Znajek is shown to be a regularity condition at fast critical surface.},

  abstract = {During the three decades since its theoretical discovery the Blandford-Znajek process of extracting the rotational energy of black holes has become one of the foundation stones in the building of modern relativistic astrophysics. However, it is also true that for a long time its physics was not well understood, as evidenced by the controversy that surrounded it since 1990s. Thanks to the efforts of many theorists during the last decade the state of affairs is gradually improving. In this lecture I attempt to explain the key ingredients of this process in more or less systematic, rigorous, and at the same time relatively simple fashion. A particular attention is paid to the similarities and differences between the Blandford-Znajek and Penrose processes. To this purpose I formulate the notion of energy counter flow. The concept of horizon membrane is replaced with the concept of vacuum as an electromagnetically active medium. The effect of negative phase velocity of electromagnetic waves in the black hole ergosphere is also discussed.},

  abstract = {This paper continues the analysis of a set of general relativistic three-dimensional MHD simulations of accreting tori in the Kerr metric with different black hole spins. We focus on bound matter inside the initial pressure maximum, where the time-averaged motion of gas is inward and an accretion disk forms. We use the flows of mass, angular momentum, and energy in order to understand dynamics in this region. The sharp reduction in accretion rate with increasing black hole spin reported in the first paper of this series is explained by a strongly spin-dependent outward flux of angular momentum conveyed electromagnetically; when a=M ! 0:9, this flux can be comparable to the inward angular momentum flux carried by the matter. In all cases, there is outward electromagnetic angular momentum flux throughout the flow; in other words, contrary to the assertions of traditional accretion disk theory, there is in general no ``stress edge,'' no surface within which the stress is zero. The retardation of accretion in the inner disk by electromagnetic torques also alters the radial distribution of surface density, an effect that may have consequences for observable properties, such as Compton reflection. The net accreted angular momentum is sufficiently depressed by electromagnetic effects that in the most rapidly spinning black holes mass growth can lead to spin-down. Spinning black holes also lose energy by Poynting flux; this rate is also a strongly increasing function of black hole spin, rising to k10\% of the rest-mass accretion rate at very high spin. As the black hole spins faster, the path of the Poynting flux changes from being predominantly within the accretion disk to being predominantly within the funnel outflow.},

To enable an understanding of this process, we provide a brief introduction to dynamics and electromagnetism in the spacetime near black holes. We then present a brief summary of the classical Blandford-Znajek mechanism and its conceptual foundations. Recently, it has become possible to study these effects in much greater detail using numerical simulation. After discussing which aspects of the problem can be handled well by numerical means and which aspects remain beyond the grasp of such methods, we summarize their results so far. Simulations have confirmed that processes akin to the classical Blandford-Znajek mechanism can launch powerful electromagnetically-dominated jets, and have shown how the jet luminosity can be related to black hole spin and concurrent accretion rate. However, they have also shown that the luminosity and variability of jets can depend strongly on magnetic field geometry. We close with a discussion of several important open questions.},

We have studied the material ejected from four NS-NS merger systems based on the hydrodynamical simulations of Ardevol-Pulpillo et al. (2019) which handle neutrino effects in an elaborate way by including neutrino equilibration with matter in optically thick regions and re-absorption in optically thin regions. We find that the neutron richness of the dynamical ejecta is significantly affected by the neutrinos emitted by the post-merger remnant, in particular when compared to a case neglecting all neutrino interactions. Our nucleosynthesis results show that a solar-like distribution of r-process elements with mass numbers \$A \textbackslash gtrsim 90\$ is produced, including a significant enrichment in Sr and a reduced production of actinides compared to simulations without inclusion of the nucleonic weak processes. The composition of the ejected matter as well as the corresponding rate of radioactive decay heating are found to be rather independent of the system mass asymmetry and the adopted equation of state. This approximate degeneracy in abundance pattern and heating rates can be favourable for extracting the ejecta properties from kilonova observations. Part II of this work will study the light curve produced by the dynamical ejecta of our four NS merger models.},

  abstract = {Context. Gamma-ray binaries are composed of a massive star and a rotation-powered pulsar with a highly relativistic wind. The collision between the winds from both objects creates a shock structure where particles are accelerated, which results in the observed high-energy emission. Aims: We want to understand the impact of the relativistic nature of the pulsar wind on the structure and stability of the colliding wind region and highlight the differences with colliding winds from massive stars. We focus on how the structure evolves with increasing values of the Lorentz factor of the pulsar wind, keeping in mind that current simulations are unable to reach the expected values of pulsar wind Lorentz factors by orders of magnitude. Methods: We use high-resolution numerical simulations with a relativistic extension to the hydrodynamics code RAMSES we have developed. We perform two-dimensional simulations, and focus on the region close to the binary, where orbital motion can be neglected. We model different values of the Lorentz factor of the pulsar wind, up to 16. Results: We determine analytic scaling relations between stellar wind collisions and gamma-ray binaries. They provide the position of the contact discontinuity. The position of the shocks strongly depends on the Lorentz factor. We find that the relativistic wind is more collimated than expected based on non-relativistic simulations. Beyond a certain distance, the shocked flow is accelerated to its initial velocity and follows adiabatic expansion. Finally, we provide guidance for extrapolation towards more realistic values of the Lorentz factor of the pulsar wind. Conclusions: We extended the adaptive mesh refinement code RAMSES to relativistic hydrodynamics. This code is suited to studying astrophysical objects, such as pulsar wind nebulae, gamma-ray bursts, or relativistic jets, and will be part of the next public release of RAMSES. Using this code we performed simulations of gamma-ray binaries up to {$\Gamma$}p = 16 and highlighted the limits and possibilities of current hydrodynamical models of gamma-ray binaries.

  abstract = {In the case involving particles the necessary and sufficient condition for the Penrose process to extract energy from a rotating black hole is absorption of particles with negative energies and angular momenta. No torque at the black-hole horizon occurs. In this article we consider the case of arbitrary fields or matter described by an unspecified, general energy-momentum tensor \$T\_\{\textbackslash mu \textbackslash nu\}\$ and show that the necessary and sufficient condition for extraction of a black hole's rotational energy is analogous to that in the mechanical Penrose process: absorption of negative energy and negative angular momentum. We also show that a necessary condition for the Penrose process to occur is for the Noether current (the conserved energy-momentum density vector) to be spacelike or past directed (timelike or null) on some part of the horizon. In the particle case, our general criterion for the occurrence of a Penrose process reproduces the standard result. In the case of relativistic jet-producing "magnetically arrested disks" we show that the negative energy and angular-momentum absorption condition is obeyed when the Blandford-Znajek mechanism is at work, and hence the high energy extraction efficiency up to \$\textbackslash sim 300\textbackslash\%\$ found in recent numerical simulations of such accretion flows results from tapping the black hole's rotational energy through the Penrose process. We show how black-hole rotational energy extraction works in this case by describing the Penrose process in terms of the Noether current.},

  abstract = {A compact accretion disk may be formed in the merger of two neutron stars or of a neutron star and a stellar-mass black hole. Outflows from such accretion disks have been identified as a major site of rapid neutron-capture (r-process) nucleosynthesis and as the source of ``red'' kilonova emissions following the first observed neutron-star merger GW170817. We present long-term general-relativistic radiation magnetohydrodynamic simulations of a typical postmerger accretion disk at initial accretion rates of \textperiodcentered M{$\sim$}1 M{$\odot$} s-1 over 400 ms postmerger. We include neutrino radiation transport that accounts for the effects of neutrino fast flavor conversions dynamically. We find ubiquitous flavor oscillations that result in a significantly more neutron-rich outflow, providing lanthanide and 3rd-peak r-process abundances similar to solar abundances. This provides strong evidence that postmerger accretion disks are a major production site of heavy r-process elements. A similar flavor effect may allow for increased lanthanide production in collapsars.},

  abstract = {The observation of a possible electromagnetic counterpart by the Fermi GBM group to the aLIGO detection of the merger of a black hole binary has spawned a number of ideas about its source. Furthermore, observations of fast radio bursts (FRBs) have similarly resulted in a range of new models that might endow black hole binaries with electromagnetic signatures. In this context, even the unlikely idea that astrophysical black holes may have significant charge is worth exploring, and here we present results from the simulation of weakly charged black holes as they orbit and merge. Our simulations suggest that a black hole binary with mass comparable to that observed in GW150914 could produce the level of electromagnetic luminosity observed by Fermi GBM (\$10\^\{49\}\$ ergs/s) with a non-dimensional charge of \$q \textbackslash equiv Q/M = 10\^\{-4\}\$ assuming good radiative efficiency. However even a charge such as this is difficult to imagine avoiding neutralization long enough for the binary to produce its electromagnetic counterpart, and so this value would likely serve simply as an upper bound. On the other hand, one can equivalently consider the black holes as having acquired a magnetic monopole charge that would be easy to maintain and would generate an identical electromagnetic signature as the electric charges. The observation of such a binary would have significant cosmological implications, not the least of which would be an explanation for the quantization of charge itself. We also study such a magnetically charged binary in the force-free regime and find it much more radiative, reducing even further the requirements to produce the counterpart.},

However, the physics of tilted discs (e.g., angular momentum transport and jet formation) is poorly understood. Using our new GPU-accelerated code H-AMR, we performed 3D general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of tilted thick accretion discs around rapidly spinning BHs, at the highest resolution to date. We explored the limit where disc thermal pressure dominates magnetic pressure, and showed for the first time that, for different magnetic field strengths on the BH, these flows launch magnetized relativistic jets propagating along the rotation axis of the tilted disc (rather than of the BH). If strong large-scale magnetic flux reaches the BH, it bends the inner few gravitational radii of the disc and jets into partial alignment with the BH spin. On longer time scales, the simulated disc-jet system as a whole undergoes LenseThirring precession and approaches alignment, demonstrating for the first time that jets can be used as probes of disc precession. When the disc turbulence is well-resolved, our isolated discs spread out, causing both the alignment and precession to slow down.},

  abstract = {Accreting black holes launch relativistic collimated jets, across many decades in luminosity and mass, suggesting the jet launching mechanism is universal, robust and scale-free. Theoretical models and general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations indicate that the key jet-making ingredient is large-scale poloidal magnetic flux. However, its origin is uncertain, and it is unknown if it can be generated in situ or dragged inward from the ambient medium. Here, we use the GPU-accelerated GRMHD code HAMR to study global 3D black hole accretion at unusually high resolutions more typical of local shearing box simulations. We demonstrate that accretion disc turbulence in a radially-extended accretion disc can generate large-scale poloidal magnetic flux in situ, even when starting from a purely toroidal magnetic field. The flux accumulates around the black hole till it becomes dynamically-important, leads to a magnetically arrested disc (MAD), and launches relativistic jets that are more powerful than the accretion flow. The jet power exceeds that of previous GRMHD toroidal field simulations by a factor of 10,000. The jets do not show significant kink or pinch instabilities, accelerate to \$\textbackslash gamma \textbackslash sim 10\$ over 3 decades in distance, and follow a collimation profile similar to the observed M87 jet.},

  abstract = {Binary neutron stars (NSNS) are expected to be among the leading sources of gravitational waves observable by ground-based laser interferometers and may be the progenitors of short-hard gamma-ray bursts. We present a series of general relativistic NSNS coalescence simulations both for unmagnetized and magnetized stars. We adopt quasiequilibrium initial data for circular, irrotational binaries constructed in the conformal thin-sandwich (CTS) framework. We adopt the BSSN formulation for evolving the metric and a high-resolution shock-capturing scheme to handle the magnetohydrodynamics. Our simulations of unmagnetized binaries agree with the results of Shibata, Taniguchi and Ury\=u [M. Shibata, K. Taniguchi, and K. Ury\=u, Phys. Rev. D 68, 084020 (2003).]. In cases in which the mergers result in a prompt collapse to a black hole, we are able to use puncture gauge conditions to extend the evolution and determine the mass of the material that forms a disk. We find that the disk mass is less than 2\% of the total mass in all cases studied. We then add a small poloidal magnetic field to the initial configurations and study the subsequent evolution. For cases in which the remnant is a hypermassive neutron star, we see measurable differences in both the amplitude and phase of the gravitational waveforms following the merger. For cases in which the remnant is a black hole surrounded by a disk, the disk mass and the gravitational waveforms are about the same as the unmagnetized cases. Magnetic fields substantially affect the long-term, secular evolution of a hypermassive neutron star (driving ``delayed collapse'') and an accretion disk around a nascent black hole.},

We show that the reconnection is facilitated by the Kruskal-Schwarzschild instability of current sheets separating the oppositely directed fields. This instability, which is a magnetic counterpart of the Rayleigh-Taylor instability, develops if the flow is accelerated. Then the plasma drips out of the current sheet providing conditions for rapid reconnection. Since the magnetic dissipation leads to the flow acceleration, the process is self-sustaining. In pulsar winds, this process could barely compete with the earlier proposed dissipation mechanisms. However, the novel mechanism turns out to be very efficient at AGN and GRB conditions.},

A previous study showed that the superposed harmonic (SH) initial data gives rise to significantly smaller junk radiation. However, it is difficult to construct SH initial data for black holes with dimensionless spin \$\textbackslash chi\textbackslash gtrsim0.7\$. We here provide a class of spatial coordinate transformations that extend SH to higher spin. The new spatial coordinate system, which we refer to as superposed modified harmonic (SMH), is characterized by a continuous parameter -- Kerr-Schild and harmonic spatial coordinates are only two special cases of this new gauge. We compare SMH with the superposed Kerr-Schild (SKS) initial data by evolving several binary black hole systems with \$\textbackslash chi=0.8\$ and \$0.9\$. We find that the new initial data still leads to less junk radiation and only small changes of black hole parameters (e.g. mass and spin). We also find that the volume-weighted constraint violations for the new initial data converge with resolution during the junk stage \$(t\textbackslash lesssim700M)\$, which means there are fewer high-frequency components in waveforms at outer regions.},

We analyze this difference and discuss the implications in the nonlinear regime for the gravitational memory effect resulting from the ejection of massive particles from an isolated system. We show that the nonlinear effect agrees with the linearized result based upon the retarded Green function only if the velocity of the ejected particle corresponds to a boost symmetry of the ingoing Minkowski background.

We begin by describing four observational results relating to the topic, with particular emphasis on jets in active galactic nuclei and parallels between different sources. We then discuss the ways in which particles can be accelerated to high energies in magnetised plasmas, focusing mainly on shock acceleration, second-order Fermi and magnetic reconnection; in the process, we attempt to shed some light on the basic conditions that must be met by any mechanism for the various observational constraints to be satisfied. We describe the limiting factors for the maximum particle energy and briefly discuss multimessenger signals from neutrinos and ultrahigh energy cosmic rays, before describing the journey of jet plasma from jet launch to cocoon with reference to the different acceleration mechanisms. We conclude with some general comments on the future outlook.},

  abstract = {A typical galaxy is thought to contain tens of millions of stellar-mass black holes, the collapsed remnants of once massive stars, and a single nuclear supermassive black hole. Both classes of black holes accrete gas from their environments. The accreting gas forms a flattened orbiting structure known as an accretion disk. During the past several years, it has become possible to obtain measurements of the spins of the two classes of black holes by modeling the x-ray emission from their accretion disks. Two methods are employed, both of which depend upon identifying the inner radius of the accretion disk with the innermost stable circular orbit, whose radius depends only on the mass and spin of the black hole. In the Fe K{$\alpha$} method, which applies to both classes of black holes, one models the profile of the relativistically broadened iron line with a special focus on the gravitationally redshifted red wing of the line. In the continuum-fitting (CF) method, which has so far only been applied to stellar-mass black holes, one models the thermal x-ray continuum spectrum of the accretion disk. We discuss both methods, with a strong emphasis on the CF method and its application to stellar-mass black holes. Spin results for eight stellar-mass black holes are summarized. These data are used to argue that the high spins of at least some of these black holes are natal, and that the presence or absence of relativistic jets in accreting black holes is not entirely determined by the spin of the black hole.},

We describe a general relativistic forcefree (GRFFE) formulation that allows general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) codes to directly evolve the GRFFE equations of motion. Established, accurate and well-tested conservative GRMHD codes can simply add a new inversion piece of code to their existing code, while continuing to use all the already-developed facilities present in their GRMHD code. We show how to enforce the E {$\cdot$} B = 0 constraint and energy conservation, and we introduce a simplified general model of the dissipation of the electric field to enforce the B2 - E2 {$>$} 0 constraint. We also introduce a simplified yet general method to resolve current sheets, without much reconnection, over many dynamical times. This formulation is incorporated into an existing GRMHD code (HARM), which is demonstrated to give accurate and robust GRFFE results for Minkowski and black hole space\textendash times.},

  abstract = {The formation and large-scale propagation of Poynting-dominated jets produced by accreting, rapidly rotating black hole systems are studied by numerically integrating the general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic equations of motion to follow the self-consistent interaction between accretion discs and black holes. This study extends previous similar work by studying jets till t {$\approx$} 104GM/c3 out to r {$\approx$} 104GM/c2, by which the jet is superfast magnetosonic and moves at a lab-frame bulk Lorentz factor of {$\sim$} 10 with a maximum terminal Lorentz factor of {$\infty$} 103. The radial structure of the Poynting-dominated jet is piece-wise self-similar, and fits to flow quantities along the field line are provided. Beyond the Alfve\textasciiacute n surface at r {$\sim$} 10\textendash 100GM/c2, the jet becomes marginally unstable to (at least) current-driven instabilities. Such instabilities drive shocks in the jet that limit the efficiency of magnetic acceleration and collimation. These instabilities also induce jet substructure with 3 15. The jet is shown to only marginally satisfy the necessary and sufficient conditions for kink instability, so this may explain how astrophysical jets can extend to large distances without completely disrupting. At large distance, the jet angular structure is Gaussian-like (or uniform within the core with sharp exponential wings) with a half-opening angle of {$\approx$}5{$\smwhtcircle$} and there is an extended component out to {$\approx$} 27{$\smwhtcircle$}. Unlike in some hydrodynamic simulations, the environment is found to play a negligible role in jet structure, acceleration, and collimation as long as the ambient pressure of the surrounding medium is small compared to the magnetic pressure in the jet.},

  abstract = {Rotating magnetized compact objects and their accretion discs can generate strong toroidal magnetic fields driving highly magnetized plasmas into relativistic jets. Of significant concern, however, has been that a strong toroidal field in the jet should be highly unstable to the nonaxisymmetric helical kink (screw) m = 1 mode leading to rapid disruption. In addition, a recent concern has been that the jet formation process itself may be unstable due to the accretion of non-dipolar magnetic fields. We describe large-scale fully three-dimensional global general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of rapidly rotating, accreting black holes producing jets. We study both the stability of the jet as it propagates and the stability of the jet formation process during accretion of dipolar and quadrupolar fields. For our dipolar model, despite strong non-axisymmetric disc turbulence, the jet reaches Lorentz factors of {$\sim$} 10 with opening half-angle \texttheta j {$\sim$} 5{$\smwhtcircle$} at 103 gravitational radii without significant disruption or dissipation with only mild substructure dominated by the m = 1 mode. On the contrary, our quadrupolar model does not produce a steady relativistic ( 3) jet due to mass loading of the polar regions caused by unstable polar fields. Thus, if produced, relativistic jets are roughly stable structures and may reach up to external shocks with strong magnetic fields. We discuss the astrophysical implications of the accreted magnetic geometry playing such a significant role in relativistic jet formation, and outline avenues for future work.},

  abstract = {In this work we present 3D numerical relativity simulations of thick accretion disks around tilted Kerr BH. We investigate the evolution of three different initial disk models with a range of initial black hole spin magnitudes and tilt angles. For all the disk-to-black hole mass ratios considered (0.044-0.16) we observe significant black hole precession and nutation during the evolution. This indicates that for such mass ratios, neglecting the self-gravity of the disks by evolving them in a fixed background black hole spacetime is not justified. We find that the two more massive models are unstable against the Papaloizou-Pringle (PP) instability and that those PP-unstable models remain unstable for all initial spins and tilt angles considered, showing that the development of the instability is a very robust feature of such PP-unstable disks. Our lightest model, which is the most astrophysically favorable outcome of mergers of binary compact objects, is stable. The tilt between the black hole spin and the disk is strongly modulated during the growth of the PP instability, causing a partial global realignment of black hole spin and disk angular momentum in the most massive model with constant specific angular momentum l. For the model with non-constant l-profile we observe a long-lived m=1 non-axisymmetric structure which shows strong oscillations of the tilt angle in the inner regions of the disk. This effect might be connected to the development of Kozai-Lidov oscillations. Our simulations also confirm earlier findings that the development of the PP instability causes the long-term emission of large amplitude gravitational waves, predominantly for the l=m=2 multipole mode. The imprint of the BH precession on the gravitational waves from tilted BH-torus systems remains an interesting open issue that would require significantly longer simulations than those presented in this work.},

The ideal constant {$\Gamma$}-law EoS, commonly adopted in a wide range of astrophysical applications, is compared with a more realistic EoS that better approximates the single-specie relativistic gas. The paper focuses on three different topics. First, the influence of a more realistic EoS on the propagation of fast magnetosonic shocks is investigated. This calls into question the validity of the constant {$\Gamma$}-law EoS in problems where the temperature of the gas substantially changes across hydromagnetic waves. Secondly, we present a new inversion scheme to recover primitive variables (such as rest-mass density and pressure) from conservative ones that allows for a general EoS and avoids catastrophic numerical cancellations in the non-relativistic and ultrarelativistic limits. Finally, selected numerical tests of astrophysical relevance (including magnetized accretion flows around Kerr black holes) are compared using different equations of state. Our main conclusion is that the choice of a realistic EoS can considerably bear upon the solution when transitions from cold to hot gas (or vice versa) are present. Under these circumstances, a polytropic EoS can significantly endanger the solution.},

By performing independent calculations of the late inspiral and merger, and by computing the electromagnetic (EM) emission in a way which is consistent with estimates using the Poynting flux, we show that a dual-jet structure is present but energetically subdominant with respect to a non-collimated and predominantly quadrupolar emission, which is similar to the one computed when the binary is in electrovacuum. While our findings set serious restrictions on the detectability of dual jets from coalescing binaries, they also increase the chances of detecting an EM counterpart from these systems.},

  abstract = {Context. High-mass microquasars (HMMQs) are systems from which  relativistic jets are launched. At the scales of several times the binary system size, the jets are expected to follow a helical path caused by the interaction with a strong stellar wind and orbital motion. Such a trajectory has its influence on the non-thermal emission of the jets, which also depends strongly on the observing angle due to Doppler boosting effects. Aims: We explore how the expected non-thermal emission of HMMQ jets at small scales is affected by the impact of the stellar wind and the orbital motion on the jet propagation.  Methods: We studied the broadband non-thermal emission, from radio to gamma rays, produced in HMMQ jets up to a distance of several orbital separations, taking into account a realistic jet trajectory, different model parameters, and orbital modulation. The jet trajectory is computed by considering momentum transfer with the stellar wind. Electrons are injected at the position where a recollimation shock in the jets is expected due to the wind impact. Their distribution along the jet path is obtained assuming local acceleration at the recollimation shock, and cooling via adiabatic, synchrotron, and inverse Compton processes. The synchrotron and inverse Compton emission is calculated taking into account synchrotron self-absorption within the jet, free-free absorption with the stellar wind, and absorption by stellar photons via pair production. Results: The spectrum is totally dominated by the jet over the counter-jet due to Doppler boosting. Broadband emission from microwaves to gamma rays is predicted, with radio emission being totally absorbed. This emission is rather concentrated in the regions close to the binary system and features strong orbital modulation at high energies. Asymmetric light curves are obtained owing to the helical trajectory of the jets. Conclusions: The presence of helical shaped jets could be inferred from asymmetries in the light curves, which become noticeable only for large jet Lorentz factors and low magnetic fields. Model parameters could be constrained if accurate phase-resolved light curves from GeV to TeV energies were available. The predictions for the synchrotron and the inverse Compton radiation are quite sensitive of the parameters determining the wind-jet interaction structure.},

Motivated by this source, we perform three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations using a modified version of the GPU-accelerated Adaptive-MEsh-Refinement hydrodynamical parallel code (GAMER) to study colliding extragalactic jets. We find that colliding jets can be cast into two categories: (1) bouncing jets, in which case the jets bounce off each other keeping their identities, and (2) merging jets, when only one jet emerges from the collision. Under some conditions the interaction causes the jets to break up into oscillating filaments of opposite helicity, with consequences for their downstream stability. When one jet is significantly faster than the other and the impact parameter is small, the jets merge; the faster jet takes over the slower one. In the case of merging jets, the oscillations of the filaments, in projection, may show a feature that resembles a double helix, similar to the radio image of 3C 75. Thus we interpret the morphology of 3C 75 as a consequence of the collision of two jets with distinctly different speeds at a small impact parameter, with the faster jet breaking up into two oscillating filaments.},

  abstract = {We present the new general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (GRMHD) capabilities of the Einstein toolkit, an open-source community-driven numerical relativity and computational relativistic astrophysics code. The GRMHD extension of the toolkit builds upon previous releases and implements the evolution of relativistic magnetized fluids in the ideal MHD limit in fully dynamical spacetimes using the same shock-capturing techniques previously applied to hydrodynamical evolution. In order to maintain the divergence-free character of the magnetic field, the code implements both constrained transport and hyperbolic divergence cleaning schemes. We present test results for a number of MHD tests in Minkowski and curved spacetimes. Minkowski tests include aligned and oblique planar shocks, cylindrical explosions, magnetic rotors, Alfv\'en waves and advected loops, as well as a set of tests designed to study the response of the divergence cleaning scheme to numerically generated monopoles. We study the code's performance in curved spacetimes with spherical accretion onto a black hole on a fixed background spacetime and in fully dynamical spacetimes by evolutions of a magnetized polytropic neutron star and of the collapse of a magnetized stellar core. Our results agree well with exact solutions where these are available and we demonstrate convergence. All code and input files used to generate the results are available on http://einsteintoolkit.org. This makes our work fully reproducible and provides new users with an introduction to applications of the code.},

  abstract = {We investigate the influence of magnetic fields on the evolution of binary neutron-star (BNS) merger remnants via three-dimensional (3D) dynamical-spacetime general-relativistic (GR) magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations. We evolve a postmerger remnant with an initial poloidal magnetic field, resolve the magnetoturbulence driven by shear flows, and include a microphysical finite-temperature equation of state (EOS). A neutrino leakage scheme that captures the overall energetics and lepton number exchange is also included. We find that turbulence induced by the magnetorotational instability (MRI) in the hypermassive neutron star (HMNS) amplifies magnetic field to beyond magnetar-strength (\$10\^\{15\}\textbackslash, \textbackslash mathrm\{G\}\$). The ultra-strong toroidal field is able to launch a relativistic jet from the HMNS. We also find a magnetized wind that ejects neutron-rich material with a rate of \$\textbackslash dot\{M\}\_\{\textbackslash mathrm\{ej\}\} \textbackslash simeq 1 \textbackslash times10\^\{-1\}\textbackslash, \textbackslash mathrm\{M\_\{\textbackslash odot\}\textbackslash, s\^\{-1\}\}\$. The total ejecta mass in our simulation is \$5\textbackslash times 10\^\{-3\}\textbackslash, \textbackslash mathrm\{M\_\{\textbackslash odot\}\}\$. This makes the ejecta from the HMNS an important component in BNS mergers and a promising source of \$r\$-process elements that can power a kilonova. The jet from the HMNS reaches a terminal Lorentz factor of \$\textbackslash sim 5\$ in our highest-resolution simulation. The formation of this jet is aided by neutrino-cooling preventing the accretion disk from protruding into the polar region. As neutrino pair-annihilation and radiative processes in the jet (which were not included in the simulations) will boost the Lorentz factor in the jet further, our simulations demonstrate that magnetars formed in BNS mergers are a viable engine for short gamma-ray bursts (sGRBs).},

  abstract = {The M87 jet is extensively examined by utilizing general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations, as well as the steady axisymmetric force-free electrodynamic (FFE) solution. Quasi-steady funnel jets are obtained in GRMHD simulations up to the scale of {$\sim$}100 gravitational radii (rg) for various black hole (BH) spins. As is known, the funnel edge is approximately determined by the following equipartitions: (i) the magnetic and rest-mass energy densities and (ii) the gas and magnetic pressures. Our numerical results give an additional factor that they follow the outermost parabolic streamline of the FFE solution, which is anchored to the event horizon on the equatorial plane. We also show that the matter-dominated, nonrelativistic corona/wind plays a dynamical role in shaping the funnel jet into the parabolic geometry. We confirm a quantitative overlap between the outermost parabolic streamline of the FFE jet and the edge of the jet sheath in very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) observations at {$\sim$}(101\textendash 105)rg, suggesting that the M87 jet is likely powered by the spinning BH. Our GRMHD simulations also indicate a lateral stratification of the bulk acceleration (i.e., the spine-sheath structure), as well as an emergence of knotty superluminal features. The spin characterizes the location of the jet stagnation surface inside the funnel. We suggest that the limb-brightened feature could be associated with the nature of the BH-driven jet, if the Doppler beaming is a dominant factor. Our findings can be examined with (sub)millimeter VLBI observations, giving a clue for the origin of the M87 jet.},

  abstract = {We construct a numerical model of emission from minijets, localized flows driven by magnetic reconnection inside Poynting-flux-dominated jets proposed to explain the ultrafast variability of blazars. The geometrical structure of the model consists of two wedge-like regions of relativistically flowing gas, separated by a stationary shock. The dynamics is based on solutions of relativistic magnetic reconnection with a guide field from Lyubarsky. Electron distributions in each region are chosen to match the pressure and density of the local plasma. Synchrotron emission from both regions is used to calculate Compton scattering, Compton drag and photon\textendash photon opacity effects, with exact treatment of anisotropy and the Klein\textendash Nishina regime. Radiative effects on plasma are taken into account, including the dependence of pressure on electron radiative losses and adiabatic heating of the flow decelerating under Compton drag. The results are applied to the 2006 July flare in the BL Lac object PKS 2155-304, with the aim of matching TeV flux measurements by the High Energy Stereoscopic System (HESS) with models that satisfy the variability constraints, while keeping X-ray emission below simultaneous Chandra observations. We find that models of isolated minijets with a significant guide field overproduce X-ray emission, and that we must take into account the radiative interaction of oppositely oriented minijets in order to achieve a high enough dominance by Comptonized TeV radiation. We argue that such interactions are likely to occur in a jet where there is substantial internal reconnection, producing a large number of misaligned minijets. Finally, we show that large jet magnetizations are indeed required to satisfy all observational constraints and that the effective Lorentz factor of the minijet plasma has to be larger than 50, in agreement with earlier one-zone estimates.},

  abstract = {It has for long been an article of faith among astrophysicists that black hole spin energy is responsible for powering the relativistic jets seen in accreting black holes. Two recent advances have strengthened the case. First, numerical general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of accreting spinning black holes show that relativistic jets form spontaneously. In at least some cases, there is unambiguous evidence that much of the jet energy comes from the black hole, not the disk. Second, spin parameters of a number of accreting stellar-mass black holes have been measured. For ballistic jets from these systems, it is found that the radio luminosity of the jet correlates with the spin of the black hole. This suggests a causal relationship between black hole spin and jet power, presumably due to a generalized Penrose process.},

  abstract = {Over the past 3 yr, the fading non-thermal emission from the GW170817 remained generally consistent with the afterglow powered by synchrotron radiation produced by the interaction of the structured jet with the ambient medium. Recent observations by Hajela et~al. indicate the change in temporal and spectral behaviour in the X-ray band. We show that the new observations are compatible with the emergence of a new component due to non-thermal emission from the fast tail of the dynamical ejecta of ab-initio binary neutron star merger simulations. This provides a new avenue to constrain binary parameters. Specifically, we find that equal mass models with soft equations of state (EOSs) and high-mass ratio models with stiff EOSs are disfavoured as they typically predict afterglows that peak too early to explain the recent observations. Moderate stiffness and mass ratio models, instead, tend to be in good overall agreement with the data.},

We performed 3D particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations of a relativistic electron-proton jet of relatively large radius that carries a helical magnetic field. We focussed our investigation on the interaction between the jet and the ambient plasma and explore how the helical magnetic field affects the excitation of kinetic instabilities such as the Weibel instability (WI), the kinetic Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (kKHI), and the mushroom instability (MI). In our simulations these kinetic instabilities are indeed excited, and particles are accelerated. At the linear stage we observe recollimation shocks near the center of the jet. As the electron-proton jet evolves into the deep nonlinear stage, the helical magnetic field becomes untangled due to reconnection-like phenomena, and electrons are repeatedly accelerated as they encounter magnetic-reconnection events in the turbulent magnetic field.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT Numerical simulation of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence makes it possible to study accretion dynamics in detail. However, special effort is required to connect inflow dynamics (dependent largely on angular momentum transport) to radiation (dependent largely on thermodynamics and photon diffusion). To this end, we extend the flux-conservative, general relativistic MHD (GRMHD) code HARM from axisymmetry to full three dimensions. The use of an energy conserving algorithm allows the energy dissipated in the course of relativistic accretion to be captured as heat. The inclusion of a simple optically thin cooling function permits explicit control of the simulated disk's geometric thickness as well as a direct calculation of both the amplitude and location of the radiative cooling associated with the accretion stresses. Fully relativistic ray-tracing is used to compute the luminosity received by distant observers. For a disk with aspect ratio H /r 0.1 accreting onto a black hole with spin parameter a/M = 0.9, we find that there is significant dissipation beyond that predicted by the classical Novikov\textendash Thorne model. However, much of it occurs deep in the potential, where photon capture and gravitational redshifting can strongly limit the net photon energy escaping to infinity. In addition, with these parameters and this radiation model, significant thermal and magnetic energy remains with the gas and is accreted by the black hole. In our model, the net luminosity reaching infinity is 6\% greater than the Novikov\textendash Thorne prediction. If the accreted thermal energy were wholly radiated, the total luminosity of the accretion flow would be 20\% greater than the Novikov\textendash Thorne value.},

  abstract = {Recent general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of accretion onto black holes (BHs) have shown that, contrary to the basic assumptions of the Novikov\textendash Thorne (NT) model, there can be substantial magnetic stress throughout the plunging region. Additional dissipation and radiation can therefore be expected. We use data from a particularly well-resolved simulation of accretion onto a non-spinning BH to compute both the radiative efficiency of such a flow and its spectrum if all emitted light is radiated with a thermal spectrum whose temperature matches the local effective temperature. This disk is geometrically thin enough (H /r 0.06) that little heat is retained in the flow. In terms of light reaching infinity (i.e., after allowance for all relativistic effects and for photon capture by the BH), we find that the radiative efficiency is at least 6\%\textendash 10\% greater than predicted by the NT model (complete radiation of all heat might yield another 6\%). We also find that the spectrum more closely resembles the NT prediction for a/M 0.2\textendash 0.3 than for the correct value, a/M = 0. As a result, if the spin of a non-spinning BH is inferred by model fitting to an NT model with known BH mass, distance, and inclination, the inferred a/M is too large by 0.2\textendash 0.3.},

  abstract = {We have simulated the magnetohydrodynamic evolution of a circumbinary disk surrounding an equal-mass binary comprising two non-spinning black holes during the period in which the disk inflow time is comparable to the binary evolution time due to gravitational radiation. Both the changing spacetime and the binary orbital evolution are described by an innovative technique utilizing high-order post-Newtonian approximations. Prior to the beginning of the inspiral, the structure of the circumbinary disk is predicted well by extrapolation from Newtonian results: a gap of roughly two binary separation radii is cleared, and matter piles up at the outer edge of this gap as inflow is retarded by torques exerted by the binary; the accretion rate is roughly half its value at large radius. During inspiral, the inner edge of the disk initially moves inward in coordination with the shrinking binary, but\textemdash as the orbital evolution accelerates\textemdash the inward motion of the disk edge falls behind the rate of binary compression. In this stage, the binary torque falls substantially, but the accretion rate decreases by only 10\%-20\%. When the binary separation is tens of gravitational radii, the rest-mass efficiency of disk radiation is a few percent, suggesting that supermassive binary black holes could be very luminous at this stage of their evolution. Inner disk heating is modulated at a beat frequency comparable to the binary orbital frequency. However, a disk with sufficient surface density to be luminous may be optically thick, suppressing periodic modulation of the luminosity.},

The inspiral of these systems is of utmost astrophysical importance as prodigious producers of gravitational waves and in their possible role in energetic electromagnetic events. We study such binary black hole coalescence under the influence of an external magnetic field produced by the expected circumbinary disk surrounding them. Solving the Einstein equations to describe the spacetime and using the force-free approach for the electromagnetic fields and the tenuous plasma, we present numerical evidence for possible jets driven by these systems. Extending the process described by Blandford and Znajek for a single spinning black hole, the picture that emerges suggests the electromagnetic field extracts energy from the orbiting black holes, which ultimately merge and settle into the standard Blandford-Znajek scenario. Emissions along dual and single jets would be expected that could be observable to large distances.},

  abstract = {The Blandford-Znajek mechanism has long been regarded as a key ingredient in models attempting to explain powerful jets in AGNs, quasars, blazzars etc. In such mechanism, energy is extracted from a rotating black hole and dissipated at a load at far distances. In the current work we examine the behaviour of the BZ mechanism with respect to different boundary conditions, revealing the mechanism robustness upon variation of these conditions. Consequently, this work closes a gap in our understanding of this important scenario.},

  abstract = {Magnetic fields are expected to play a key role in the dynamics and the ejection mechanisms that accompany the merger of two neutron stars. General relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations offer a unique opportunity to unravel the details of the ongoing physical processes. Nevertheless, current numerical studies are severely limited by the fact that any affordable resolution remains insufficient to fully capture the small-scale dynamo, initially triggered by the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, and later sourced by several MHD processes involving differential rotation. Here, we alleviate this limitation by using explicit large-eddy simulations, a technique where the unresolved dynamics occurring at the sub-grid scales (SGS) is modeled by extra terms, which are functions of the resolved fields and their derivatives. The combination of high-order numerical schemes, high resolutions, and the gradient SGS model allow us to capture the small-scale dynamos produced during the binary neutron star mergers. Here we follow the first 50 milliseconds after the merger and, for the first time, we find numerical convergence on the magnetic field amplification, in terms of integrated energy and spectral distribution over spatial scales. We also find that the average intensity of the magnetic field in the remnant saturates at \$\textbackslash sim 10\^\{16\}\$\textasciitilde G around \$5\$\textasciitilde ms after the merger. After \$20-30\$\textasciitilde ms, both toroidal and poloidal magnetic field components grow continuously, fed by the winding mechanism that provides a slow inverse cascade. We find no clear hints for magneto-rotational instabilities, and no significant impact of the magnetic field on the redistribution of angular momentum in the remnant in our simulations, probably due to the very turbulent and dynamical topology of the magnetic field at all stages, with small-scale components largely dominating over the large-scale ones.},

We investigate the effect of the relevant model parameters on the X-ray, optical, and radio fluxes and the effect of a refreshed shock energy input and anisotropy in the ejecta on the shape of the light curves. We compare our numerical results to observed afterglows and give a quantitative description of the conditions (geometry and physical parameters) in the ejecta that are compatible with the light curves of the GRB 970508 afterglow, for which a large number of accurate flux measurements are available. We find that the radio, optical, and X-ray light curves of this afterglow can be explained satisfactorily within the spherically symmetric fireball model, assuming a delayed energy injection, or by an axially symmetric jet surrounded by a less energetic outflow.},

  abstract = {The standard general relativistic model of a razor-thin accretion disk around a black hole, developed by Novikov \& Thorne (NT) in 1973, assumes the shear stress vanishes at the radius of the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) and that, outside the ISCO, the shear stress is produced by an effective turbulent viscosity. However, astrophysical accretion disks are not razor-thin, it is uncertain whether the shear stress necessarily vanishes at the ISCO, and the magnetic field, which is thought to drive turbulence in disks, may contain large-scale structures that do not behave like a simple local scalar viscosity. We describe three-dimensional general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of accretion disks around black holes with a range of spin parameters, and we use the simulations to assess the validity of the NT model. Our fiducial initial magnetic field consists of multiple (alternating polarity) poloidal field loops whose shape is roughly isotropic in the disk in order to match the isotropic turbulence expected in the poloidal plane. For a thin disk with an aspect ratio |h/r| \textasciitilde{} 0.07 around a non-spinning black hole, we find a decrease in the accreted specific angular momentum of 2.9\% relative to the NT model and an excess luminosity from inside the ISCO of 3.5\%. The deviations in the case of spinning black holes are of the same order. In addition, the deviations decrease with decreasing |h/r|. We therefore conclude that magnetized thin accretion disks in x-ray binaries in the thermal/high-soft spectral state ought to be well-described by the NT model, especially at luminosities below 30\% of Eddington where we expect a very small disk thickness |h/r| {$<\sptilde$} 0.05. We also discuss how the stress and the luminosity inside the ISCO depend on the assumed initial magnetic field geometry. (abridged)},

  abstract = {Context: Strong interactions between jets and stellar winds at binary-system, spatial-scales could occur in high-mass microquasars. Aims: We study here, mainly from a dynamical but also a radiative point of view, the collision between a dense stellar wind and a mildly relativistic hydrodynamical jet of supersonic nature. Methods: We have performed numerical two-dimensional simulations of jets, with cylindrical and planar (slab) symmetry, crossing the stellar-wind material. From the results of the simulations, we derive estimates of the particle acceleration efficiency, using first-order, Fermi-acceleration theory, and provide insight into the possible radiative outcomes. Results: We find that, during jet launching, the jet head generates a strong shock in the wind. During and after this process, strong recollimation shocks can occur due to the initial overpressure of the jet with its environment. The conditions in all these shocks are convenient to accelerate particles up to \textasciitilde TeV energies, which can lead to leptonic (synchrotron and inverse Compton) and hadronic (proton-proton) radiation. In principle, the cylindrical jet simulations show that the jet is stable, and can escape from the system even at relatively low power. However, when accounting for the wind ram pressure, the jet can be bent and disrupted for power {$\lnapprox$} 1036 erg s-1.},

  abstract = {Powerful flares from blazars with short ({$\sim$}min) variability time-scales are challenging for current models of blazar emission. Here, we present a physically motivated ab initio model for blazar flares based on the results of recent particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations of relativistic magnetic reconnection. PIC simulations demonstrate that quasi-spherical plasmoids filled with high-energy particles and magnetic fields are a self-consistent by-product of the reconnection process. By coupling our PIC-based results (i.e. plasmoid growth, acceleration profile, particle and magnetic content) with a kinetic equation for the evolution of the electron distribution function we demonstrate that relativistic reconnection in blazar jets can produce powerful flares whose temporal and spectral properties are consistent with the observations. In particular, our model predicts correlated synchrotron and synchrotron self-Compton flares of duration of several hours\textendash days powered by the largest and slowest moving plasmoids that form in the reconnection layer. Smaller and faster plasmoids produce flares of sub-hour duration with higher peak luminosities than those powered by the largest plasmoids. Yet, the observed fluence in both types of flares is similar. Multiple flares with a range of flux-doubling time-scales (minutes to several hours) observed over a longer period of flaring activity (days or longer) may be used as a probe of the reconnection layer's orientation and the jet's magnetization. Our model shows that blazar flares are naturally expected as a result of magnetic reconnection in a magnetically dominated jet.},

We identify these difficulties as stemming form some terminological misunderstandings as to what is meant by "gauge invariance", or what is understood classically by a "physical state". We make a thorough analysis of the issue and show that all purported paradoxes disappear when the right terminology is in place. Since this issue is connected with the search of observables - gauge invariant quantities - for these theories, we formally show that time evolving observables can be constructed for every observer. This construction relies on the fixation of the gauge freedom of diffeomorphism invariance by means of a scalar coordinatization. We stress the condition that the coordinatization must be made with scalars. As an example of our method for obtaining observables we discuss the case of the massive particle in AdS spacetime.},

  abstract = {We calculate the severe radiative energy losses which occur at the base  of black hole jets using a relativistic fluid jet model, including in situ acceleration of non-thermal leptons by magnetic reconnection. Our results demonstrate that including a self-consistent treatment of radiative energy losses is necessary to perform accurate magnetohydrodynamic simulations of powerful jets and that jet spectra calculated via post-processing are liable to vastly overestimate the amount of non-thermal emission. If no more than 95 per cent of the initial total jet power is radiated away by the plasma travels as it travels along the length of the jet, we can place a lower bound on the magnetization of the jet plasma at the base of the jet. For typical powerful jets, we find that the plasma at the jet base is required to be highly magnetized, with at least 10 000 times more energy contained in magnetic fields than in non-thermal leptons. Using a simple power-law model of magnetic reconnection, motivated by simulations of collisionless reconnection, we determine the allowed range of the large-scale average reconnection rate along the jet, by restricting the total radiative energy losses incurred and the distance at which the jet first comes into equipartition. We calculate analytic expressions for the cumulative radiative energy losses due to synchrotron and inverse-Compton emission along jets, and derive analytic formulae for the constraint on the initial magnetization.},

  abstract = {We present fully general-relativistic simulations of binary neutron star mergers with a temperature and composition dependent nuclear equation of state. We study the dynamical mass ejection from both quasi-circular and dynamical-capture eccentric mergers. We systematically vary the level of our treatment of the microphysics to isolate the effects of neutrino cooling and heating and we compute the nucleosynthetic yields of the ejecta. We find that eccentric binaries can eject significantly more material than quasi-circular binaries and generate bright infrared and radio emission. In all our simulations the outflow is composed of a combination of tidally- and shock-driven ejecta, mostly distributed over a broad \$\textbackslash sim 60\^\textbackslash circ\$ angle from the orbital plane, and, to a lesser extent, by thermally driven winds at high latitudes. Ejecta from eccentric mergers are typically more neutron rich than those of quasi-circular mergers. We find neutrino cooling and heating to affect, quantitatively and qualitatively, composition, morphology, and total mass of the outflows. This is also reflected in the infrared and radio signatures of the binary. The final nucleosynthetic yields of the ejecta are robust and insensitive to input physics or merger type in the regions of the second and third r-process peaks. The yields for elements on the first peak vary between our simulations, but none of our models is able to explain the Solar abundances of first-peak elements without invoking additional first-peak contributions from either neutrino and viscously-driven winds operating on longer timescales after the mergers, or from core-collapse supernovae.},

  abstract = {We present a new moment-based neutrino transport code for neutron star merger simulations in general relativity. In the merger context, ours is the first code to include Doppler effects at all orders in \$v/c\$, retaining all nonlinear neutrino-matter coupling terms. The code is validated with a stringent series of tests. We show that the inclusion of full neutrino-matter coupling terms is necessary to correctly capture the trapping of neutrinos in relativistically moving media, such as in differentially rotating merger remnants. We perform preliminary simulations proving the robustness of the scheme in simulating ab-initio mergers to black hole collapse and long-term neutron star remnants up to \$\{\textbackslash sim\}70\textbackslash,\$ms. The latter is the longest dynamical spacetime, 3D, general relativistic simulations with full neutrino transport to date. We compare results obtained at different resolutions and using two different closures for the moment scheme. We do not find evidences of significant out-of-thermodynamic equilibrium effects, such as bulk viscosity, on the postmerger dynamics or gravitational wave emission. Neutrino luminosities and average energies are in good agreement with theory expectations and previous simulations by other groups using similar schemes. We compare dynamical and early wind ejecta properties obtained with M1 and with our older neutrino treatment. We find that the M1 results have systematically larger proton fractions. However, the differences in the nucleosynthesis yields are modest. This work sets the basis for future detailed studies spanning a wider set of neutrino reactions, binaries and equations of state.},

These signatures are expected when the mass ratio between the holes is not extreme and the system is fed by a circumbinary disk. One such signature is a notch in the thermal continuum that has been predicted by other authors; we point out that it should be accompanied by a spectral revival at shorter wavelengths and also discuss its dependence on binary properties such as mass, mass ratio, and separation. In particular, we note that the wavelength {$\lambda$}n at which the notch occurs depends on these three parameters in such a way as to make the number of systems displaying these notches {$\propto$} {$\lambda$}1n6/3; longer wavelength searches are therefore strongly favored. A second signature, first discussed here, is hard X-ray emission with a Wien-like spectrum at a characteristic temperature {$\sim$}100 keV produced by Compton cooling of the shock generated when streams from the circumbinary disk hit the accretion disks around the individual black holes. We investigate the observability of both signatures. The hard X-ray signal may be particularly valuable as it can provide an indicator of black hole merger a few decades in advance of the event.},

  abstract = {Microquasars are accreting X-ray binary systems with non-thermal radio jets. In some of these systems the jet is expected to be strongly misaligned with the perpendicular to the orbital plane. If the donor star is an early-type star, the jet could collide with the stellar wind producing a standing shock between the compact object and the stellar surface. Relativistic particles injected by the jet can be re-accelerated and isotropized at the colliding region. If the jet has hadronic content, TeV protons will diffuse into the inner, dense wind leading to gamma-ray and neutrino production from interactions with the matter of the wind. In the case of very powerful jets, the wind pressure can be overbalanced and the jet might impact directly onto the stellar surface. We present estimates of the gamma-ray and neutrino luminosities for different sets of parameters in these scenarios and we briefly discuss the effects of this radiation on the donor star and its detectability with current instruments.},

Singular space-time models do not belong to the ontology of the world: they are not things but concepts, i.e. defective solutions of Einstein's field equations.

A polar magnetospheric gap is formed that spans the open field lines from the stellar surface up to an altitude of about 10,000 cm. The scalar product of the electric and magnetic fields is nonzero in the gap, although it vanishes essentially everywhere else in the near magnetosphere. The potential difference between the base and the top of the gap is about 1 trillion volts. The gap continually breaks down by forming electron-positron pairs on a time scale of a few microseconds. The gap positrons move out along the open field lines and electrons flow to the stellar surface to close the pulsar's homopolar generator circuit. The proposed model can explain many characteristics of the coherent microwave radiation observed from pulsars.},

  abstract = {The Blandford-Znajek process, one of the most promising model for powering the relativistic jets from black holes, was initially introduced as a mechanism in which the magnetic fields extract energy from a rotating black hole. We study the evolution of force-free electromagnetic fields on regular spacetimes with an ergosphere, which are generated by rapidly rotating stars. Our conclusive results confirm previous works, claiming that the Blandford-Znajek mechanism is not directly related to the horizon of the black hole. We also show that the radiated energy depends exponentially on the compactness of the star.},

  abstract = {The conventional group of four-dimensional diffeomorphisms is not realizeable as a canonical transformation group in phase space. Yet there is a larger field-dependent symmetry transformation group which does faithfully reproduce 4-D diffeomorphism symmetries. Some properties of this group were first explored by Bergmann and Komar. More recently the group has been analyzed from the perspective of projectability under the Legendre map. Time translation is not a realizeable symmetry, and is therefore distinct from diffeomorphism-induced symmetries. This issue is explored further in this paper. It is shown that time is not "frozen". Indeed, time-like diffeomorphism invariants must be time-dependent. Intrinsic coordinates of the type proposed by Bergmann and Komar are used to construct invariants. Lapse and shift variables are retained as canonical variables in this approach, and therefore will be subject to quantum fluctuations in an eventual quantum theory. Concepts and constructions are illustrated using the relativistic classical and quantum free particle. In this example concrete time-dependent invariants are displayed and fluctuation in proper time is manifest.},

We consider characteristic Mach numbers of the Keplerian flow between 10 and 50 and both inviscid discs and discs with an internal shear viscosity. We calculate the angular momentum transfer between the disc and the companion star and indicate how the excited spiral density waves can be understood in terms of a linear tidal response calculation. In agreement with earlier work it is found that hot, extended discs with Mach numbers \^{$<$}10, such as those in close binary T Tauri stars, are subject to strong tidal coupling with the companion star, whereby the disc loses a sufficient amount of angular momentum through shock dissipation to enable disc matter to accrete on to the central star. For cool discs with Mach numbers \^ 25, thought typical for discs in cataclysmic variable and X-ray binaries, however, the wavelength of the tidal response is much shorter than the length-scale of the tidal force so that the tidal interaction becomes inefficient and, although adequate to truncate the disc, it produces little wave-driven accretion on to the central star.},

Many of the observed features have now been identified as collective effects arising from the self-gravity of the ring material. These effects include spiral density waves and spiral bending waves, the main topics of this review. Both kinds of waves were first discussed in the astronomical literature in connection with the dynamics and structure of spiral galaxies, and the present discussion contrasts the similarities and differences between the disks of galaxies and planetary rings. After developing the theory of free and forced waves of both types, the way in which the observed waves can be used as diagnostics to obtain crucial parameters that characterize the physical state of the rings is discussed.},

  abstract = {General-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations are an important tool to study a variety of astrophysical systems such as neutron star mergers, core-collapse supernovae, and accretion onto compact objects. A conservative GRMHD scheme numerically evolves a set of conservation equations for ``conserved'' quantities and requires the computation of certain primitive variables at every time step. This recovery procedure constitutes a core part of any conservative GRMHD scheme and it is closely tied to the equation of state (EOS) of the fluid. In the quest to include nuclear physics, weak interactions, and neutrino physics, state-of-the-art GRMHD simulations employ finite-temperature, composition-dependent EOSs. While different schemes have individually been proposed, the recovery problem still remains a major source of error, failure, and inefficiency in GRMHD simulations with advanced microphysics. The strengths and weaknesses of the different schemes when compared to each other remain unclear. Here we present the first systematic comparison of various recovery schemes used in different dynamical spacetime GRMHD codes for both analytic and tabulated microphysical EOSs. We assess the schemes in terms of (i) speed, (ii) accuracy, and (iii) robustness. We find large variations among the different schemes and that there is not a single ideal scheme. While the computationally most efficient schemes are less robust, the most robust schemes are computationally less efficient. More robust schemes may require an order of magnitude more calls to the EOS, which are computationally expensive. We propose an optimal strategy of an efficient three-dimensional Newton\textendash Raphson scheme and a slower but more robust one-dimensional scheme as a fall-back.},

  abstract = {Observations of gamma-ray-bursts and jets from active galactic nuclei reveal that the jet flow is characterized by a high radiative efficiency and that the dissipative mechanism must be a powerful accelerator of non-thermal particles. Shocks and magnetic reconnection have long been considered as possible candidates for powering the jet emission. Recent progress via fully-kinetic particle-in-cell simulations allows us to revisit this issue on firm physical grounds. We show that shock models are unlikely to account for the jet emission. In fact, when shocks are efficient at dissipating energy, they typically do not accelerate particles far beyond the thermal energy, and vice versa. In contrast, we show that magnetic reconnection can deposit more than 50 per cent of the dissipated energy into non-thermal leptons as long as the energy density of the magnetic field in the bulk flow is larger than the rest-mass energy density. The emitting region, i.e. the reconnection downstream, is characterized by a rough energy equipartition between magnetic fields and radiating particles, which naturally accounts for a commonly observed property of blazar jets.},

  abstract = {Optical periodicity QSOs found by transient surveys are suggested to be sub-parsec supermassive binary black holes (BBHs). An intriguing interpretation for the periodicity of some of those QSOs is that the continuum is radiated from the accretion disk associated with the BBH secondary component and modulated by the periodical rotation of the secondary via Doppler-boost effect. Close to edge-on orbital orientation can lead to more significant Doppler-boost effect and thus are preferred for these systems, which is distinct from those normal type-1 QSOs with more or less face-on orientations. Therefore, the profiles of broad lines emitted from these Doppler-modulated systems may be significantly different from other systems that are not Doppler-modulated. We investigate the properties of the broad emission lines of optical-periodicity QSOs, including both a sample of QSOs that can be interpreted by the Doppler-modulated effects and a sample that cannot. We find that there is no obvious difference in the profiles and other properties of various (stacked) broad emission lines of these two samples, though a simple broad line region model would suggest significant differences. Our finding raises a challenge to the Doppler boost hypothesis for some of those BBHs candidates with optical periodicity.},

Our method is based on that of Blanchet, Faye, and Ponsot, who use a post-Newtonian metric valid for general (continuous) fluids and represent pointlike compact objects with a delta-function stress-energy tensor, regularizing divergent terms by taking the Hadamard finite part. To obtain post-Newtonian spin effects, we use a different delta-function stress-energy tensor introduced by Bailey and Israel. In a future paper we will use the 2.5PN equations of motion for spinning bodies to derive the gravitational-wave luminosity and phase evolution of binary inspirals, which will be useful in constructing matched filters for signal analysis. The gravitational field derived here may help in posing initial data for numerical evolutions of binary black hole mergers.},

  abstract = {We study the physical processes in the system containing the 47 ms radio  pulsar PSR B1259-63 orbiting around a Be star in a highly eccentric orbit. This system is the only known binary where a radio pulsar is observed to interact with gaseous material from a Be star. A rapidly rotating radio pulsar such as PSR B1259-63 is expected to produce a wind of electromagnetic emission and relativistic particles, and this binary is an ideal astrophysical laboratory to study the mass outflow/pulsar interaction in a highly time-variable environment. Motivated by the results of a recent multiwavelength campaign during the 1994 January periastron passage of PSR B1259-63, we discuss several issues regarding the mechanism of high-energy emission. Unpulsed power-law emission from the PSR B1259-63 system was detected near periastron in the energy range 1-200 keV. The observed X-ray/soft {$\gamma$}-ray emission is characterized by moderate luminosity, small and constant column density, lack of detectable pulsations, and peculiar spectral and intensity variability. In principle, high-energy (X-ray and gamma-ray) emission from the system can be produced by different mechanisms including (1) mass accretion onto the surface of the neutron star, (2) ``propeller''-like magnetospheric interaction at a small pulsar distance, and (3) shock-powered emission in a pulsar wind termination shock at a large distance from the pulsar. We carry out a series of calculations aimed at modeling the high-energy data of the PSR B1259-63 system throughout its orbit and especially near periastron. We find that the observed high-energy emission from the PSR B1259-63 system is not compatible with accretion or propeller-powered emission. This conclusion is supported by a model based on standard properties of Be stars and for plausible assumptions about the pulsar/outflow interaction geometry. We find that shock-powered high-energy emission produced by the pulsar/outflow interaction is consistent with all the characteristics of the high-energy emission of the PSR B1259-63 system. This opens the possibility of obtaining for the first time constraints on the physical properties of the PSR B1259-63 pulsar wind and its interaction properties in a strongly time-variable nebular environment. By studying the time evolution of the pulsar cavity, we can constrain the magnitude and geometry of the mass outflow as the PSR B1259-63 orbits around its Be star companion. The pulsar/outflow interaction is most likely mediated by a collisionless shock at the internal boundary of the pulsar cavity. The system shows all the characteristics of a binary plerion being diffuse and compact near apastron and periastron, respectively. The PSR B1259-63 system is subject to different radiative regimes depending on whether synchrotron or inverse-Compton (IC) cooling dominates the radiation of electron/positron pairs (e+/- pairs) advected away from the inner boundary of the pulsar cavity. The highly nonthermal nature of the observed X-ray/soft {$\gamma$}-ray emission from the PSR B1259-63 system near periastron establishes the existence of an efficient particle acceleration mechanism within a timescale shown to be less than \textasciitilde 102-103 s. A synchrotron/IC model of emission of e+/- pairs accelerated at the inner shock front of the pulsar cavity and adiabatically expanding in the MHD flow provides an excellent explanation of the observed time-variable X-ray flux and spectrum from the PSR B1259-63 system. We find that the best model for the PSR B1259-63 system is consistent with the pulsar orbital plane being misaligned with the plane of a thick equatorial Be star outflow. The angular width of the equatorially enhanced Be star outflow is constrained to be \textasciitilde 50\textdegree{} at the pulsar distance, and the misalignment angle is {$>\sptilde$}25\textdegree. We calculate the intensity and spectrum of the high-energy emission for the whole PSR B1259-63 orbit and predict the characteristics of the emission near the apastron region based on the periastron results. The mass-loss rate is deduced to be approximately constant in time during a \textasciitilde 2 yr period. Our results for the Be star outflow of the PSR B1259-63 system are consistent with models of the radio eclipses near periastron. The consequences of our analysis have general validity. Our study of the PSR B1259-63 system shows that X-ray emission can be caused by a mechanism alternative to accretion in a system containing an energetic pulsar interacting with nebular material. This fact can have far-reaching consequences for the interpretation of galactic astrophysical systems showing nonthermal X-ray and {$\gamma$}-ray emission. We show that a binary system such as PSR B1259-63 offers a novel way to study the acceleration process of relativistic plasmas subject to strongly time variable radiative environments.},

  abstract = {We examine the motion and tidal dynamics of a nonrotating black hole placed within a post-Newtonian external spacetime. The tidal perturbation created by the external environment is treated as a small perturbation. At a large distance from the black hole, the gravitational field of the external distribution of matter is assumed to be sufficiently weak to be adequately described by the (first) post-Newtonian approximation to general relativity. There, the black hole is treated as a monopole contribution to the total gravitational field. There exists an overlap in the domains of validity of each description, and the black-hole and post-Newtonian metrics are matched in the overlap. The matching procedure produces the equations of motion for the black hole and the gravito-electric and gravito-magnetic tidal fields acting on the black hole. We first calculate the equations of motion and tidal fields by making no assumptions regarding the nature of the post-Newtonian environment; this could contain a continuous distribution of matter or any number of condensed bodies. We next specialize our discussion to a situation in which the black hole is a member of a post-Newtonian two-body system. As an application of our results, we examine the geometry of the deformed event horizon and calculate the tidal heating of the black hole, the rate at which it acquires mass as a result of its tidal interaction with the companion body.},

  abstract = {We describe global, 3D, time-dependent, non-radiative, general-relativistic, magnetohydrodynamic simulations of accreting black holes (BHs). The simulations are designed to transport a large amount of magnetic flux to the centre, more than the accreting gas can force into the BH. The excess magnetic flux remains outside the BH, impedes accretion, and leads to a magnetically arrested disc. We find powerful outflows. For a BH with spin parameter a = 0.5, the efficiency with which the accretion system generates outflowing energy in jets and winds is {$\eta$} {$\approx$} 30 per cent. For a = 0.99, we find {$\eta$} {$\approx$} 140 per cent, which means that more energy flows out of the BH than flows in. The only way this can happen is by extracting spin energy from the BH. Thus the a = 0.99 simulation represents an unambiguous demonstration, within an astrophysically plausible scenario, of the extraction of net energy from a spinning BH via the Penrose\textendash Blandford\textendash Znajek mechanism. We suggest that magnetically arrested accretion might explain observations of active galactic nuclei with apparent {$\eta$} {$\approx$} few \texttimes{} 100 per cent.},

  abstract = {Seven schemes to maintain the {$\nabla\cdot$}B=0 constraint numerically are compared. All these algorithms can be combined with shock-capturing Godunov type base schemes. They fall into three categories: the eight-wave formulation maintains the constraint to truncation error, the projection scheme enforces the constraint in some discretization by projecting the magnetic field, while the five different versions of the constrained transport/central difference type schemes conserve {$\nabla\cdot$}B to machine accuracy in some discretization for every grid cell. It is shown that the three constrained transport algorithms, which have been introduced recently, can be recast into pure finite volume schemes, and the staggered representation of the magnetic field is unnecessary. Another two new and simple central difference based algorithms are introduced. The properties of the projection scheme are discussed in some detail, and I prove that it has the same order of accuracy as the base scheme even for discontinuous solutions. I describe a flexible and efficient implementation of the projection scheme using conjugate gradient type iterative methods. Generalizations to resistive MHD, to axial symmetry, and to non-Cartesian grids are given for all schemes. The theoretical discussion is followed by numerical tests, where the robustness, accuracy, and efficiency of the seven schemes and the base scheme can be directly compared. All simulations are done with the Versatile Advection Code, in which several shock-capturing base schemes are implemented. Although the eight-wave formulation usually works correctly, one of the numerical tests demonstrates that its non-conservative nature can occasionally produce incorrect jumps across strong discontinuities. Based on a large number of tests, the projection scheme, one of the new central difference based schemes, and one of the constrained transport schemes are found to be the most accurate and reliable among the examined methods.},

  abstract = {It is by now fairly well established that gamma-ray burst afterglows result from initially relativistic outflows interacting with the medium surrounding the burster and emitting non-thermal radiation ranging from radio to X-rays. However, beyond that, many big and small questions remain about afterglows, with the accumulating amount of observational data at the various frequencies raising as many questions as they answer. In this review I highlight a number of current theoretical issues and how they fit or do not fit within our basic theoretical framework. In addition to theoretical progress I will also emphasize the increasing role and usefulness of numerical studies of afterglow blast waves and their radiation.},

  abstract = {We present improvements to construction of binary black hole initial data used in SpEC (the Spectral Einstein Code). We introduce new boundary conditions for the extended conformal thin sandwich elliptic equations that enforce the excision surfaces to be slightly inside rather than on the apparent horizons, thus avoiding extrapolation into the black holes at the last stage of initial data construction. We find that this improves initial data constraint violations near and inside the apparent horizons by about 3 orders of magnitude. We construct several initial data sets that are intended to be astrophysically equivalent but use different free data, boundary conditions, and initial gauge conditions. These include free data chosen as a superposition of two black holes in time-independent horizon-penetrating harmonic and damped harmonic coordinates. We also implement initial data for which the initial gauge satisfies the harmonic and damped harmonic gauge conditions; this can be done independently of the free data, since this amounts to a choice of the time derivatives of the lapse and shift. We compare these initial data sets by evolving them. We show that the gravitational waveforms extracted during the evolution of these different initial data sets agree very well after excluding initial transients. However, we do find small differences between these waveforms, which we attribute to small differences in initial orbital eccentricity, and in initial BH masses and spins, resulting from the different choices of free data. Among the cases considered, we find that superposed harmonic initial data leads to significantly smaller transients, smaller variation in BH spins and masses during these transients, smaller constraint violations, and more computationally efficient evolutions. Finally, we study the impact of initial data choices on the construction of zero-eccentricity initial data.},

  abstract = {Context. The central regions of galaxies are complex environments, rich  in evolved and/or massive stars. For galaxies hosting an active galactic nucleus (AGN) with jets, the interaction of the jets with the winds of the stars within can lead to particle acceleration, and to extended high-energy emitting regions. Aims: We compute the non-thermal emission produced by the jet flow shocked by stellar winds on the jet scale, far from the jet-star direct interaction region. Methods: First, prescriptions for the winds of the relevant stellar populations in different types of galaxies are obtained. The scenarios adopted include galaxies with their central regions dominated by old or young stellar populations, and with jets of different power. Then, we estimate the available energy to accelerate particles in the jet shock, and compute the transport and energy evolution of the accelerated electrons, plus their synchrotron and inverse Compton emission, in the shocked flow along the jet. Results: A significant fraction of the jet energy, 0.1 - 10\%, can potentially be available for the particles accelerated in jet-wind shocks in the studied cases. The non-thermal particles can produce most of the high-energy radiation on jet scales, far from the jet shock region. This high-energy emission will be strongly enhanced in jets aligned with the line of sight due to Doppler boosting effects. Conclusions: The interaction of relativistic jets with stellar winds may contribute significantly to the persistent high-energy emission in some AGNs with jets. However, in the particular case of M 87, this component seems too low to explain the observed gamma-ray fluxes.},

In a starburst galaxy hosting an active galactic nucleus with a relativistic jet, supernovae can take place inside the jet. The collision of the supernova ejecta with the jet flow is expected to lead to the formation of an interaction region, in which particles can be accelerated and produce high-energy emission.\emph{Aims{$<$}i/{$>$}. We study the non-thermal radiation produced by electrons accelerated as a result of a supernova explosion inside the jet of an active galactic nucleus within a star-forming galaxy.\emph{Methods{$<$}i/{$>$}. We first analyzed the dynamical evolution of the supernova ejecta impacted by the jet. Then, we explored the parameter space using simple prescriptions for the observed gamma-ray lightcurve. Finally, the synchrotron and the inverse Compton spectral energy distributions for two types of sources, a radio galaxy and a powerful blazar, are computed.\emph{Results{$<$}i/{$>$}. For a radio galaxy, the interaction between a supernova and a jet of power {$\sim$}10\textsuperscript{43{$<$}sup/{$>$} - 10\textsuperscript{44{$<$}sup/{$>$} erg s\textsuperscript{-1{$<$}sup/{$>$} can produce apparent gamma-ray luminosities of {$\sim$}10\textsuperscript{42{$<$}sup/{$>$} - 10\textsuperscript{43{$<$}sup/{$>$} erg s\textsuperscript{-1{$<$}sup/{$>$}, with an event duty cycle of supernova remnant interacting with the jet close to one for one galaxy. For a blazar with a powerful jet of {$\sim$}10\textsuperscript{46{$<$}sup/{$>$} erg s\textsuperscript{-1{$<$}sup/{$>$}, the jet-supernova ejecta interaction could produce apparent gamma-ray luminosities of {$\sim$}10\textsuperscript{43{$<$}sup/{$>$} - 10\textsuperscript{44{$<$}sup/{$>$} erg s\textsuperscript{-1{$<$}sup/{$>$}, but with a much lower duty cycle.\emph{Conclusions{$<$}i/{$>$}. The interaction of supernovae with misaligned jets of moderate power can be relatively frequent, and can result in steady gamma-ray emission potentially detectable for sources in the local universe. For powerful blazars much farther away, the emission would be steady as well, and it might be detectable under very efficient acceleration, but the events would be rather infrequent.}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}},

The code is a direct extension of the hydrodynamic code of Hawley, Smarr, \& Wilson and uses Evans \& Hawley constrained transport (CT) to evolve the magnetic fields. Two categories of test cases were undertaken. A one-dimensional version of the code (Minkowski metric) was used to verify code performance in the special relativistic limit. The tests include Alfv\'en wave propagation, fast and slow magnetosonic shocks, rarefaction waves, and both relativistic and nonrelativistic shock tubes. A series of one- and two-dimensional tests were also carried out in the Kerr metric: magnetized Bondi inflow, a magnetized inflow test due to Gammie, and two-dimensional magnetized constant- l tori that are subject to the magnetorotational instability.},

  abstract = {Massive black holes (MBHs) inhabit galaxy centers, power luminous quasars and Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) and shape their cosmic environment with the energy they produce. The origins of MBHs remain a mystery and the recent detection by LIGO/Virgo of an almost 150 solar mass black hole has revitalized the question of whether there is a continuum between ``stellar'' and ``massive'' black holes and what the seeds of MBHs are. Seeds could have formed in the first galaxies, or could be also related to the collapse of horizon-sized regions in the early Universe. Understanding the origins of MBHs straddles fundamental physics, cosmology and astrophysics and it bridges the fields of gravitational wave physics and traditional astronomy. With several facilities in the next 10-15 years we foresee the possibility of discovering MBHs' avenues of formation. In this article we link three main topics: the channels of black hole seed formation, the journey from seeds to massive black holes, the diagnostics on the origins of MBHs. We highlight and critically discuss current unsolved problems and touch on recent developments that stirred the community.},

  abstract = {We derive the gravitational waveform and gravitational-wave energy flux generated by a binary star system of compact objects (neutron stars or black holes), accurate through second post-Newtonian order (O[(vc)4]=O[(Gmrc2)2]) beyond the lowest-order quadrupole approximation. We cast the Einstein equations into the form of a flat-spacetime wave equation together with a harmonic gauge condition, and solve it formally as a retarded integral over the past null cone of the chosen field point. The part of this integral that involves the matter sources and the near-zone gravitational field is evaluated in terms of multipole moments using standard techniques; the remainder of the retarded integral, extending over the radiation zone, is evaluated in a novel way. The result is a manifestly convergent and finite procedure for calculating gravitational radiation to arbitrary orders in a post-Newtonian expansion. Through second post-Newtonian order, the radiation is also shown to propagate toward the observer along true null rays of the asymptotically Schwarzschild spacetime, despite having been derived using flat-spacetime wave equations. The method cures defects that plagued previous "brute-force" slow-motion approaches to the generation of gravitational radiation, and yields results that agree perfectly with those recently obtained by a mixed post-Minkowskian post-Newtonian method. We display explicit formulas for the gravitational waveform and the energy flux for two-body systems, both in arbitrary orbits and in circular orbits. In an appendix, we extend the formalism to bodies with finite spatial extent, and derive the spin corrections to the waveform and energy loss.},

We describe our implementation of initial and boundary conditions, r-process heating, and opacities for kilonova simulations. We validate our approach by carefully checking that energy conservation is satisfied and by comparing the \textbackslash texttt\{SNEC\} results with those of two semi-analytic light curve models. We apply our code to the calculation of color light curves for three binaries having different mass ratios (equal and unequal mass) and different merger outcome (short-lived and long-lived remnants). We study the sensitivity of our results to hydrodynamic effects, nuclear physics uncertainties in the heating rates, and duration of the merger simulations. We also study the impact of shocks possibly launched into the outflows by a relativistic jet. None of our models match AT2017gfo, the kilonova in GW170817. This points to possible deficiencies in the merger simulations and to the need to go beyond the assumption of spherical symmetry adopted in this work.},

  abstract = {Black hole accretion flows can be divided into two broad classes: cold and hot. Whereas cold accretion flows consist of cool optically thick gas and are found at relatively high mass accretion rates, hot accretion flows, the topic of this review, are virially hot and optically thin, and occur at lower mass accretion rates. They are described by accretion solutions such as the advection-dominated accretion flow and luminous hot accretion flow. Because of energy advection, the radiative efficiency of these flows is in general lower than that of a standard thin accretion disk. Moreover, the efficiency decreases with decreasing mass accretion rate. Observations show that hot accretion flows are associated with jets. In addition, theoretical arguments suggest that hot flows should produce strong winds. Hot accretion flows are believed to be present in low-luminosity active galactic nuclei and in black hole X-ray binaries in the hard and quiescent states. The prototype is Sgr A*, the ultralow-luminosity supermassive black hole at our Galactic center. The jet, wind, and radiation from a supermassive black hole with a hot accretion flow can interact with the external interstellar medium and modify the evolution of the host galaxy.}

  abstract = {We present an approximate metric for a binary black hole spacetime to construct initial data for numerical relativity. This metric is obtained by asymptotically matching a post-Newtonian metric for a binary system to a perturbed Schwarzschild metric for each hole. In the inner zone near each hole, the metric is given by the Schwarzschild solution plus a quadrupolar perturbation corresponding to an external tidal gravitational field. In the near zone, well outside each black hole but less than a reduced wavelength from the center of mass of the binary, the metric is given by a post-Newtonian expansion including the lowest-order deviations from flat spacetime. When the near zone overlaps each inner zone in a buffer zone, the post-Newtonian and perturbed Schwarzschild metrics can be asymptotically matched to each other. By demanding matching (over a 4-volume in the buffer zone) rather than patching (choosing a particular 2-surface in the buffer zone), we guarantee that the errors are small in all zones. The resulting piecewise metric is made formally \$C\^\textbackslash infty\$ with smooth transition functions so as to obtain the finite extrinsic curvature of a 3-slice. In addition to the metric and extrinsic curvature, we present explicit results for the lapse and the shift, which can be used as initial data for numerical simulations. This initial data is not accurate all the way to the asymptotically flat ends inside each hole, and therefore must be used with evolution codes which employ black hole excision rather than puncture methods. This paper lays the foundations of a method that can be sraightforwardly iterated to obtain initial data to higher perturbative order.},

This approximation assumes that the external universe changes slowly relative to the rotation rate of the hole, thus allowing the parameterization of the Newman-Penrose scalar \$\textbackslash psi\_0\$ by time-dependent electric and magnetic tidal tensors. This approximation, however, does not constrain how big the spin of the background hole can be and, in principle, the perturbed metric can model rapidly spinning holes. We first generate a potential by acting with a differential operator on \$\textbackslash psi\_0\$. From this potential we arrive at the metric perturbation by use of the Chrzanowski procedure in the ingoing radiation gauge. We provide explicit analytic formulae for this metric perturbation in spherical Kerr-Schild coordinates, where the perturbation is finite at the horizon. This perturbation is parametrized by the mass and Kerr spin parameter of the background hole together with the electric and magnetic tidal tensors that describe the time evolution of the perturbation produced by the external universe. In order to take the metric accurate far away from the hole, these tidal tensors should be determined by asymptotically matching this metric to another one valid far from the hole. The tidally perturbed metric constructed here could be useful in initial data constructions to describe the metric near the horizons of a binary system of spinning holes. This perturbed metric could also be used to construct waveforms and study the absorption of mass and angular momentum by a Kerr black hole when external processes generate gravitational radiation.},

  abstract = {We present a new warped gridding scheme adapted to simulating gas dynamics in binary black hole spacetimes. The grid concentrates grid points in the vicinity of each black hole to resolve the smaller scale structures there, and rarefies grid points away from each black hole to keep the overall problem size at a practical level. In this respect, our system can be thought of as a "double" version of the fisheye coordinate system, used before in numerical relativity codes for evolving binary black holes. The gridding scheme is constructed as a mapping between a uniform coordinate system--in which the equations of motion are solved--to the distorted system representing the spatial locations of our grid points. Since we are motivated to eventually use this system for circumbinary disc calculations, we demonstrate how the distorted system can be constructed to asymptote to the typical spherical polar coordinate system, amenable to efficiently simulating orbiting gas flows about central objects with little numerical diffusion. We discuss its implementation in the Harm3d code, tailored to evolve the magnetohydrodynamics equations in curved spacetimes. We evaluate the performance of the system's implementation in Harm3d with a series of tests, such as the advected magnetic field loop test, magnetized Bondi accretion, and evolutions of hydrodynamic discs about a single black hole and about a binary black hole. Like we have done with Harm3d, this gridding scheme can be implemented in other unigrid codes as a (possibly) simpler alternative to adaptive mesh refinement.},
